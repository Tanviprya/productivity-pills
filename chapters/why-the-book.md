# why the book

- loved self help books since I was a kid

  - You Can Win: Positive thinking has shaped my life for the better

- people keep asking questions

- I figured it would be nice for a normal person to write a book like this. Someone who's not giving gyan from the top. Someone who's doing the hustle everyday and still working on things he loves after office.
  - someone who hasn't been a topper all his life
  - but has taken matter in his own hands whenever needed
