More than 2000 years ago great philosopher, master and visionary Plato had stated, "Lack of activity destroys the good conditions of every human being while movement and methodological physical exercises save it and preserve it."

It is said, 'How strong the desire maybe we cannot accomplish even a simple task in our hand if we are not in good health.' Some important benefits of doing daily exercises are:

1. It improves cardiorespiratory functions, decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, increases stroke volume and cardiac output.
1. It improves muscular capacity i.e. increases strength, increases basal metabolic rate, improves joint strength and overall posture.
1. It protects us from Diabetes and high blood pressure.
1. It helps us to cope up with daily stresses of our life in better way.
1. It helps to accomplish daily routine work efficiently and effectively.
1. It Decreases the risk of injuries. It improves resistance power against diseases too.

Three times elected Prime Minister of UK Edward Stanley had stated strongly, _"Those who think they have no time for exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness."_

Now we have to discuss here how to use the time of physical exercise in better way. For general people who exercise for enhancing or maintaining their general body fitness, a mixture of 20 minutes aerobic exercises, 10 minutes light weight exercises (we can use our own body weight to fulfil this need ) and 10 minutes flexibility exercises are enough.

While exercising in place of using an alarm I used to listen different kind of useful audios of the field in which I have to improve my knowledge or related to the project in my hand.
One can use some motivational music and videos too as per their mood. Start doing exercise at least 10 minutes from today, if you have not started yet. It will not going to kill your time but it will make you able to become more productive for doing your other daily routine work efficiently. It improve our memory and boost our mood too.

30 to 40 minutes of systematic exercise sessions at least 5 days per week will help you lead a happy and healthy life. It improves the total functional capacity of an individual to perform a given task.

The Hindi Doha which has inspired me a lot for continuing my exercise schedule in my life is, _"Dukh mein sumiran sab karen, sukh mein kare na koi. Jo sukh mein sumiran karen dukh kahe ko hoye."_ It means, it is better to start our daily exercise programme when we are healthy. So whatever the condition you are facing in your life, do start exercising from today. Start from easy and entertaining exercise programme according to your mood and capacity.
