## Introduction

I think we all agree that this is the biggest problem on our path to productivity. We all want to do more, start new things, finish the started ones but our wishes never turn into actions.

**What's your type?**

Do we all suffer from procrastination? Yes.... and No! I feel there are three categories of people. Take a look and tell me who you are:

1.  The So called Free-Souls : _procrastinate no matter what_
They don't care about the deadline, if they don't feel like working, they won't. It's okay for them to fail in exams or not complete any important task at hand. After all, what are exams for? A structure created by the society to exploit these creative souls!

2.  The Thrill Seekers : _procrastinate till panic hits_ 
They delay their assignments till the last moment or their studies till the night before the exam. They often struggle to start the work earlier than a few days before the deadline.

3. The Do or Die-rs : _what's procrastination_? 
These are the toppers, the planners, the executors. They will be found in the library even during normal days, preparing for the exams scheduled for next month.

**Do you need this chapter?**

*If you fall in the third category, you don't need this chapter.*

 You're already doing your best. My advice is not to push yourself more. Rather, prioritise your work better and don't signup for too many things. Most importantly, take care of your health and social life.

*If you fall in the first, this chapter won't help you.* 

Unless, of course, you understand that when you sign up for a system you have to respect the system and not revolt against or game it. I belonged to this category for quite sometime, so, honestly, I know how it feels. We think that the stakes are too low to care for that deadline, that assignment or that exam. However, this attitude soon becomes a habit and an excuse to be lazy. Gradually, the repercussions of failure at small tasks start mounting and cumulatively takes you far away from where you could have been in life. So, for you my advice is to, first, come and join me in the second category.

*I fall in the second category right now.* 

This whole chapter is meant for people like me. Don't let this category get you down, we are good enough. We work on things when the deadline is near; get into intense focus mode and close the task. But we do need help in one major area: Doing something outside the job.
How can we do tasks that don't have deadlines? Be it writing books, creating podcasts, or creating online courses, working on side projects or learning new things. Whatever our side hustle or growth plan is, if it's fizzling out after office hours, then this chapter will be helpful.

## motivation is fleeting

Many a times, I get this question, "How do you find motivation to do all this?". I understand where this question is coming from. It's hard to make yourself work after a tiring day at office or college. But the question in itself is wrong. I'll explain why.

We think that to work more or to work hard we need to listen to some motivational speaker. We watch a video and we feel motivated, but after few hours that motivation fizzles. This leads to half baked projects. 

> Motivation is cheap, work is not.

To make something worthy you need to put in constant work in it.  These three steps will help you to put in that work:

1. **Discipline** 

I don't know how people define it. For me, it's simple: If I decide that I will write a blog after hours, I'll do that. Or, if I decide that I'll be in office by 8 A.M. everyday, I'll be there. This sounds and is hard, but once you get into the discipline you're basically limiting the choices from yourself. These decisions result in amplifying your will power and you start achieving things that look impossible to the outside world. Discipline plays the most important role but it demands short term sacrifices.

> Productivity needs sacrifices, learn to make it.

Read more about this and will power in Satyam Sir's version of this chapter.
Let's say we decide to get disciplined. But the main issue is : how to find what to be disciplined about? Enter routines.

2. **Routine** 

When I was young(er!), I read quotes about how routine kills creativity and what not. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Routine, simply, means that you don't need to decide every hour what's the next thing you want to do. Whether you would like to have breakfast, or go to the gym, or wake up at 6 A.M. or 10. When you free your brain from these menial decisions, your brain can focus on more important things, i.e. the core tasks. Setting up a routine also fights procrastination. Once you have a routine that everyday after office you will sit and write or record for 2 hours, it will be easier to start it. Again, don't give your brain the choice on the menial decisions. You must be thinking now, "Oh! This sounds so robotic! I don't want to lose control of my life, I want to be in the decisive chair". Okay! but you don't need to decide every menial thing every day, is it? So, when do we decide? Enter prioritization.

3. **Prioritization** 

The best way to know what to decide upon, and what not, is taking small steps in rhythm. Define a cadence: weekly, monthly, quarterly. Every week sit for an hour and decide what you want to work on for that week. If you get a lot of options, ask yourself what's the one thing you want to work on. And work on that only.  Choose just one task, every week, or start of the week or morning. Put it in your routine. Define exact time for it ( 30 to 60 minutes at max) Start small. Remember, even if you have discipline and routine, and you bite more than you can chew, you're setting yourself up for failure. Don't do that. 

> Key to productivity: Never set yourself up for failure.


>### *PRO*-Start
> Choose to get disciplined. Get a pen and a notebook and start making your routine now. Think and **prioritize only one thing** you want to do after office/college for this week. Trust me, it can be done! And go ahead, share it with your Pro-community by tagging @tanaypratap on Instagram/Twitter.


## Your lizard brain

Before we go deep into how to tackle this beast. We should first understand why we procrastinate because a problem well-defined is half-solved. We know everyone procrastinates. If it's such a bad thing, then why didn't the evolution of mankind outgrow procrastination?

We didn't evolve out of it because it had an evolutionary advantage. Ages ago, when we weren't this equipped, thinking of a massive task and doing it would have killed us. Therefore, natural selection took care of those ancestors who, on a bright sunny day, thought of going and drilling a hole in a mountain ending up dead due to dehydration. People who didn't exhaust themselves with following draining ideas lived and we are their children.

These experiences has wired our brain to conserve energy. When we think of a task which seems insurmountable at the moment, our brain's fight or flight response kicks in due to the fear of failure. Ultimately, our brain tells us that there's no point in pursuing this overwhelming task, because we might die.

There's a simple way to trick our brain. It's called **two minute trick**. Instead of thinking, "I am going to sit and write for 2 hours today", tell yourself that you'll just sit and write for 2 minutes. The moment your brain gets into inertia your reptile/lizard brain takes the back seat and your sophisticated/human brain takes over and this brain can complete the task! 

>### *PRO*-Start
> In next one hour, whenever you feel like checking social media instead of reading this book. Tell yourself "I will just read for next two minutes."

However, to tell yourself that you will only work for 2 or 5 minutes you should know and understand the value of small wins and that's where the next section comes into picture.

## small wins

**Smaller is better** 

As we talked in previous section, a major reason why we procrastinate is that the task seems overwhelming. We talked about the two minute trick. But that trick works only when you have done some good planning ahead (see the planning better chapter to understand better). To make sure that you get productive as soon as you start, you need to sub-divide your tasks into chunks. For example, when we started writing this book, we envisioned to write everything we know about productivity and thus we were noting down ideas. But we couldn't write a lot of chapters. Then one day, we discussed and decided that the first version of this book will have the 10 best ideas we know and implement. We choose 5 ideas each. Now, we had clear goals i.e., to write 10 chapters. Then I created mini notes for the chapters I wanted to write. The actual work didn't seem overwhelming after it was researched, planned, discussed, divided and closed. To write one or two section everyday was a 30 minutes task. And gradually, day after day, I wrote my part.

> Laps feel easy than completing the stretch?

**Celebrating every win** 

One more thing which we did and I think you should do it too, no matter what you're working on : Celebrate every milestone. Whenever we completed one chapter we posted it on our WhatsApp group. The other author and our editor would read it, congratulate us on completing 10% of the work. Instead of looking forward to completing the book _one fine day_, we started looking forward to complete _one chapter_ and sharing and celebrating it. Every chapter I completed, I shared it either with close friends, or on my personal Instagram. It felt great! We'll talk about this system in detail in the next section. Of all the things, I have done, writing this book had been the most difficult one, but breaking it into smaller and smaller chunks and celebrating every chunk made the whole journey a pure delight.

> Celebration helps in visualization of the finish line and trains your lizard brain to not get afraid of starting any task.

**Having a reward** 

While we say that good work is its own reward. I see that having a reward system for completing every task is often recommended. This is something I don't do and have never tried. However, this might work for you. You can delay your gratification and make it a reward for every completed task be it something you like to eat, watching a TV series, reading that favorite novel etc.

>### *PRO*-Start
> Earlier you decided to prioritize and write down only one thing you want do this week. Lets sub-divide it into smaller chunks now and work on it. Do not forget celebrate every milestone. Do amplify your happiness by sharing it with your Pro-community. (Tag @tanaypratap on Instagram). Every step counts.

## Solve the energy problem

Sometimes the problem is not the conservation of energy done by our lizard brain. But we're actually tired and we can't make our body move to do anything anymore. As there are tiring days in office, there are bad days in life too. And that's okay. As long as you're _mindful_ about your energy state, it's okay to say, "hey! I did enough today, let me have a break".

> It's okay to take breaks every once in a while, but if it's happening daily then maybe you're not operating at 100% energy.

The office work or college classes demanding 8-9 hours, at max,  shouldn't drain you every day. And if this is a repeating pattern, I strongly recommend to start doing some exercise to oxygenate your body. We all feel bouts of energy after good exercise, don't we? Use that after-time to do the thing you're procrastinating on. Taking care of your health is important because it controls your energy levels and enable you to do more things. So, if you find yourself drained constantly, having no energy whatsoever to work on your personal growth check your: body, sleep and food. We will give you a road-map on this in the effective exercise chapter.

## Team-up

Although, we will talk about using teamwork to multiply our productivity in detail in a different chapter, the effects of teamwork on procrastination is worth some discussion. I can't say for other people, but teamwork has worked wonders for me. To be honest, from this book, to research paper, to newsletter everything is done with one or more person as a team. A team mate provides you the required push on a side project. Together both of you try to build a regular cadence of closing tasks.

For this book, we use this metaphor of tennis, where I would write one chapter and send it to Satyam Sir and say, "Ball's in your court now!". And then he would do the same. The pull and push in a team helps your momentum.

The other thing, which I have found quite useful is treating my students as my team. I give them a deadline, well in advance, announcing that they'll have a course on X tech on Youtube by this weekend. That creates an artificial deadline for me where the panic monster takes over and I get the work done. (Remember, I am also in the second category of 'Thrill seekers' with you. So, I create my own thrill. ) The takeaway from this could be that you can use social media as your team by making public declarations. 

> Public image is a good tool to fight procrastination.

>### *PRO*-Start
>  Fill in this declaration and share :
>"I am going to __________________ ( for e.g., write a blog/read this book)  this weekend/week, and if I don't hold me responsible!" and tag us. Decide and do it now. You have your team here (your Pro-community).

## Streak is the biggest reward

It's 11:53 P.M., I had a long day at office with tons of work, but I'm still writing this book. Why? Because when we started writing this book, we didn't have a clear deadline, because let's be honest, first, no one was paying us to do this. Second, this is the first time ever, we thought of writing a book. The thought itself was daunting. Hence, after first few months of tidal movements, I decided to do something which has worked for me before.

I took a sheet of paper, drew boxes on it and pasted it in my bedroom, telling myself that everyday I must write five hundred words at least, and then I will color a box!. Just this simple: **making the progress visible** process maintained the momentum. Days where I felt like I am too tired and can't write, I was unable to let my _streak_ go. I am not kidding, one day my neighbour had a little accident, and I took her to the hospital. Sitting in the hospital, I felt my streak might break. But, the moment doctor took her in, I glued to that seat and wrote my 500 words (the effective learning chapter) on my phone.

> Trust me on this, streak is its own reward!

I knew this would work as I had done this before. This is about a time when I wished to be fit, I created a streak of 1 year plus, where I walked every day for 1 hour. Whenever I couldn't do it by 11 P.M., I would be possessed by a supernatural power and walk for the next one hour. It used to be super awkward whenever I was at a party and I haven't done my steps, I would excuse myself and go for a walk. You know how cruel your friends can be when you do something this weird? I know, you know.

Slowly, I started planning the day around this. I realised that to maintain a streak like this one must plan well. I can't just write 500 words daily. So, whenever I had more time in hand, I did my research for the book, created outlines, put pointers. Then, the only thing left to do would be to actually _sit and write_.

Many people who go to gym, or start a new project lose the momentum. Why? It's because they **don't see real progress** happening. If you put few extra kilos and go to the gym even for a week or two, there won't be any visible changes. Similarly, writing 500 words per day would only complete small part of this book. But, the streak chart helps by projecting the progress away from the real deal, making your daily progress visible and releasing happy hormones everyday. These are some good hormones to get addicted too. :)

## Procrastination is good for creativity

Procrastination is not always bad. An interesting thing came up when I was reading the book named Originals written by Adam Grant, a Wharton Professor, to which I related instantly. It turns out that the people who are more creative in their field, the "Originals", tend to procrastinate a lot. Now! please don't throw away this book and feel that your life is sorted, read ahead.

The truth is that when we are working on a piece of art, something which needs our creative brain more, procrastination is a good thing. Personally, when I have to give a talk, or do a YouTube live, I put the slide preparation aside for the last minute. Does this mean things magically happen in that last minute and I get super creative and produce awesome talks? No! Actually I, or many people who follow this practice, do not mark their work "complete" until the last minute. We keep taking notes on our phones, keep doing research, bookmarking projects, checking out new memes to be used in the talk, or thinking of good analogies. Our brain is an amazing machine, if you don't mark a creative task complete it will keep thinking about it day and night, sometimes in a separate thread and giving you amazing ideas. If you learn to use this technique right your final output will always be better than something which you would have sat and completed in one go. Whereas, don't overuse it or you'll feel exhausted. Learn to use the diffuse mode right and it can produce amazing results.

> Remember! Do not procrastinate on work, do it on the final output.

## Using procrastination as a signal

People who are super productive in life, do procrastinate on a lot of things. Some programmers who are really good at their craft, takes weeks to write a programming blog. If you ask me to code an app, I will be always ready, but to write one chapter of the book I had to make a chart and color boxes daily. I have never made any chart for programming. I have been doing it for 15 years and still jump at any opportunity with excitement.

The point is that when you put off any task repeatedly, that's a signal that your core strength doesn't reside there. Once you start reading these signals, you can differentiate what feels like work from what feels like play. Another aspect is timing. There are particular times in a day when you might be less prone to procrastinate a particular task than the other. There's a [lot of research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201906/the-most-creative-time-day) around the circadian rhythm and creative tasks. If you take the time to read it and tap into those signals as well, you might be able to be more productive around a certain type of work.

When we started this chapter we talked that the main focus will be side projects, blogs, books or anything you want to do where there's no strict deadlines. But, you should give it a thought that if you're procrastinating around these things repeatedly, maybe that's a signal that you don't enjoy it enough. Don't pickup something that dreadful after college or office, if not, do change your approach or, find a team partner which enjoys exactly that part which you dread.

At last, I would go on to suggest that, if you're intelligent and work in a field which has demand, this signal applies to your job as well. Quit the job if you don't feel excited about doing it and you feel like cutting corners everyday. However, quitting college or job is a dangerous advice to give to someone. So please think carefully and please find that thing which you actually "enjoy" and which has a bright future before following the quitting advice. Don't blame me later.

The last two sections are discussed to state that procrastination is not always bad. It's a tool for creativity and a signal from your soul. Once you understand it better, have a beautiful relationship with it, it will help you succeed.
