## Conflict of upbringing

The main problem with us, the nerds and geeks of India (can't comment about other countries), is that we were never programmed to work in a team during our childhood. Moreover, we were always pressurised and encouraged to compete against the kid next door, our classmates, cousins and everyone around us. Do you remember any subject where you were examined for **teamwork**? No? Then, it would be fair to say that, as a society, we are raising our kids wrong.

## The popular problem

While researching for this book, we conducted few surveys with students and employees to analyse the reasons stopping them from working on their side projects, coding or anything else, in after-hours? And almost everyone responded with a similar issue:  losing the motivation as no one asks or enquires about their side projects. It is well-known that we complete our homework, our office work or our school projects that has approaching deadlines or anticipatory reward attached to them. Basically, we only do work when we are answerable to someone.
The solution to this popular problem is to get a teammate, a learning buddy or a project partner. They will help you whenever you won't feel like working, and you will help them whenever they feel the same. It leads to the creation of a symbiotic relationship and can be beautifully put as **the pull push dynamics of learning**. 

Let's discuss the requisites for creating this learning dynamics and finding you a teammate.

## Take that constructive step

We know that  we are raised to be competitive and this instilled habit needs to change. To find a teammate, we must first cultivate a counter-habit of looking forward to help. 

> Learn to meet everyone with an intent to listen and construct on their thoughts, not to argue and prove your intelligence

( internet is flooded with such people).  Make a conscious effort to hear not only the words but listen to help. Find out the **complete message** that they are trying to communicated, for instances look for what they're looking for, or the challenges they are facing, or their interests. Remember, **first step is communication**.

>### *PRO*-Start
> Go and talk to anyone near you or call someone or find someone online, however possible, talk to a person and consciously try to listen and be constructive about it. Do it now. Find something to help, if not, learn about their interests or give them a genuine compliment. Realise that feeling.

I would suggest you to read #15, first, to understand more on how and where to find a teammate.


## Learn to pitch perfect

Simply put, do your homework. People like people who are well prepared on a project. Do not make a one page doc or a PPT stating "I have a million dollar idea and I'm looking for a technical co-founder". It's vague and uninviting. Don't do that. Don't be that person. Be the person who comes up with exact tasks, clear goals and defined wins for the other person. 
Once you have done your homework and gained clarity, reach out to those people whose interests align with your goals. Don't panic, you already have their names in your mind. They are the ones you listened to with an intent to help, as discussed in previous step, and whose interests aligned with yours. Always, and I repeat, always strive to create **a win-win situation**.

## I have a team!

When people ask me, "Tanay! how can you do so many things? Podcasts, Youtube, Book, Newsletter etc.?", all I say is, "***I have a team***" (and I say it with full flair like Tony Stark did in Avengers). Believe me, the ardour is real.  We are a team of 3 for podcasts, 2 for newsletter, 3 for this book and an entire group on Youtube/Instagram (we call ourselves the Meta Universe). I don't think I have any project which I am doing by myself.

## Who is your perfect teammate?

Your perfect teammate will always be someone with the expertise in a different field from yours. Let's take this book as an example, productivity is not my forte, I got accidental success here, so I roped in an expert, Satyam Sir, who has done extensive study on it. Whereas, Moosa, my React Newsletter teammate, has tons of experience in marketing. He took care of the entire setup, and I took care of the content curation. Following my forte in content curation, I have formed a list of few things that I look for in a teammate. This might be helpful for you:

1. Expertise
1. Motivation and Commitment: They should have some success and delivery history.
1. Intelligence and Awareness: They might bring new ideas to the table.
1. Most importantly, personal connection and fun quotient:  You are going to spend a lot of time with this person, might as well have fun while at it.

I have been almost always successful in finding the right teammate for my projects. At the same time, I try to imbibe these 4 qualities to become a better teammate for others and be included in a team when they come up with an idea.

>### *PRO*- Q
> Ask yourself and write it down (Now!):
> * What are some others qualities you think you might need in your teammate?
> * What are the qualities you bring as a teammate? Do a check for the 4 qualities mentioned above as well.

> Share it with your Pro-community, if you like.
