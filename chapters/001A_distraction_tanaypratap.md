## Are you committed to your phone?

We know that phone eats our time like nothing else in this world, even then we keep using it. Why? Because we are addicted to it.
The change in our brain's internal wirings have made it crave for something novel every five minutes. This change has affected our ability to concentrate, learn something effectively or do any meaningful work.

_Tell me if you can relate to one of these behaviours:_

> - You can only do work under duress.
>   For instance, you work only when there’s a deadline approaching or you have to update work-status to some authority.
> - The moment it gets boring, while you are trying to learn a new skill or concentrate on something, your hand automatically (without realisation) goes for your phone.
> - You get in a lift/bus/public place/queue, knowing you’re going to wait for like 2-5 minutes at max, your hand reaches your pocket for your phone.

Yes? No worries. This used to happen with me all the time until I started looking at it through my mind’s eyes. Now, I see folks glued to their screens everywhere. Even at social gatherings, people can’t help but check their phones every so often. Earlier, I was one of those people. So, what did I do?

### Digital Detox?

Like everyone out there, I too thought of doing a digital detox. You know, the one where we announce our departure on social media and delete all the apps from our phone and feel like a hermit. I tried. But, did that work? No! Then?

### Physical separation helps

Then, I started researching around productivity and last year I discovered this **simple trick** of physical separation. Whenever I had some work demanding my utmost attention, like in office or when I am doing a course or writing something, I follow this : I switch off the internet on my phone and keep it away. In office, I keep it in my bag. At home, I keep it on the bookshelf physically away from me. Try this and you’ll be amazed how good the saying, “Out of sight, out of mind” is.

### what about calls?

One good thing about 24x7 connectivity is that people won’t call unless it’s a real emergency. Use this to your advantage. Know that you won’t miss out on anything important.
For work related pings, communication is the key. Personally, I have told my managers and colleagues that my internet will be off when I am at home, so please call if there is an absolute need. They understand that not so important issues will be handled and replied next day during work hours. This understanding also helps me to maintain a healthy work life balance and is the key to my productivity at home. Bottom line is:

> Lose your phone to do your best work.

## My quick tricks for help

We know that we can't cut ourselves from the outer world in order to be productive. But there's one thing that we can do, i.e, to be mindful about it. Instead of giving the Internet the power to distract us whenever it wants, we can use some methods to : a) connect only when we wish to and, b) stay disconnected unless an active effort is made. I have listed few of those methods that I follow and might be helpful for you :

1. **StayFocused Chrome Extension:** Since our primary work is on the browser, be it a web developer like me or any other professional, we can't just uninstall it. Habitually, we might find ourselves lured into the novelty and glamor of social media, not knowing when or how to stop. However, there are plugins which would stop you from unknowingly wasting your time on Reddit, Twitter or other places. You can use these extensions to maintain focus, and also configure it to give you X amount of time in a day for social media.

2. **Active Zen Hours:** Practice staying away from the Internet for a couple of hours everyday. Especially, if your nature of work involves staying connected. You'll be avoiding a lot of mental troubles down the line. Set hours aside during weekday and weekend and do anything you like, but stay away from the internet.

> We have lived millennia without net, we can manage few hours.

3. **Decluttering your desktop:** If you have a game, a book, a file, a movie and all the 101 distracting things, right in front of you when you open your computer, chances are that you will click on one of those. It's been more than 12 years since I had an icon on my desktop.
   Remember the shortcut keys and search. It is easy and quick nowadays. If you search for "terminal" you won't get "angry birds" as a result and you can quickly launch into your work.

> Don't fight yourself all the time. Rather remove the temptation.

4. **Write on Paper:** No matter what you use, if you open a computer to do some serious writing work, you're going to get distracted. I have a separate account on my machine which always has zero office related apps installed. I log into that account whenever I plan to do serious writing. However, writing on paper is still better because even if you feel like going over the internet, you can't. It's good for your eyes and it's good for your brains. Bonus!

> Things you write on paper are etched into your brain much better.

5. **Switch off your notifications:** I have thousands of followers across social media channels and if I keep my notifications 'On', there will be a comment-ping every few minutes. Which will make it difficult for me to not go and look for the comment. Your brain wants to know whether it's a good or bad comment. Point being, we will face this problem irrespective of our social media following. The solution is simple: switch off the notifications. People who want to reach me, have my number. Actively manage your push notifications and trust me you're not going to miss out on anything.

> This #fomo culture has compelled us to miss out on our true potential.

6. **Stay away from group chats:** Oh! I saved the worst for the last. Group chats are the worst form of communication invented since I don't know! Anyone can trigger a communication at anytime and everyone then feels compelled to say something. The worst kinds are the family or office group chats discussing something or anything. I have so many issues with group chats that if I start writing about how it's destroying our civilisation it will form another book itself. Therefore, to be concise, save yourself from this abomination. If you are added to a group chat where you can't leave, simply mute. If anyone on LinkedIn, or any other social media says, "Hey! I am creating a group for X professions, comment yes, if you like to join", never comment "Yes"!. There are better ways to network and stay updated than wasting your time on group chats.

> Find those better ways, save time and elevate your productivity.
