## Problem with endings

The first rule of solving any problem is to ask right questions. So, let's ask ourselves : Don't we all have a lot of half-finished projects in our repositories? Few domains bought for those projects?  Do we start building something with great enthusiasm, create a repo, create a website, start coding and then abandon it after few days? If the answer to any of these questions or the similar ones is affirmative, then that's a good news because we know the underlying-reason to these situations. While there can be multiple reasons for abandoning something, but the lack of planning is always the primary one. This chapter brings you ways to deal with this problem. Whether it is about a personal or official project, these steps will help you to complete and deliver them.


## Sub-divide and conquer

The most essential skill in planning better and completing one's project is the ability to create subtasks. We must remember that, 

> "The ability to sub-task is the most underrated skill".

A lot of managers, who are really good at their work, have acquired this skill in breaking the problem into smaller problems and keep reiterating that process. I have worked with such managers during my tenure at Microsoft and have realised that this habit is one of the reason for their prodigious success. Hence, remember that if you can break a task into tasks of 1 hour, it will lead to it's completion with an increased execution speed because this sort of planning fights procrastination. (#17 )

>### *PRO*- Start
> Take a pen and notebook and pick one of your half-finished projects. Write your desired end state for that project and then break it down into subtasks leading to 1-hour tasks.

## Learn to respect

We know that to learn anything we need to work hard but the journey becomes more congenial if we respect what we are learning. A programmer can't be good at his/her work if they do not respect it work. The respect usually comes from the hard work they had to put in, the challenges they faced and their love for their work. Similarly, every profession or skill demands respect first. For instance, Project Management is as much a skill as programming. One must respect it as a science and as an art. They must realise that it has its own challenges and there's a reason corporations pay managers such hefty sum. 
Hence, to learn any skill or get into any profession first learn to respect it. Then start small by learning the tools of the trade. For instance, if you wish to understand project management, learning to prepare a kanban board, to write specifications or do delivery tracking are enough to get you started. Similarly, find the tools that are used in your desired profession and start learning their usage.

We will go more specific in the next-half of this chapter to build a flow-chart for planning the execution of any idea. Lets imagine that you have an idea to build a project.

## Ask that most dreaded question

The first question that we should ask ourselves before starting anything, any project in this case, is whether there's an actual requirement for it. If you're creating a project around teaching some skill, then make sure that learning that skill is essential. If you're creating a project to solve a problem, step one would be to do some research and see if a tool already exists, and if not then why not. Understand that though the idea seems novel at first, there's no novel idea on the planet. Everyone has thought of everything. So, do your research thoroughly. Ask yourself, if you really want to build it and if it's actually needed, and keep asking this question to yourself at every step.


## Get the idea about your idea

Once you have done some research around the requirements, write down your idea in a one to two pages. Define your goals clearly, the features it will support in the first version and develop an idea for your MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
Now, you have got the initial idea of what you're signing up for, ask the question again, "Do I really need to build this?"

## Don't shave that yak

Let's be more specific and take this real-world example, where you get an idea about building an app. First you think that it definitely needs a website. So you go out and searched for the best thing out there and heard about something called Gatsby. You wanted to use what everyone is using and talking about. You learnt GraphQL to use Gatsby spending weekdays and weekends to understand this new tech and resolving errors. Now take a moment and realise how far you came from actually programming the app and solving the real problem? That's what we do, we get into the details of things, related but unimportant, that distract us  from our original goal. 
This happens to everyone. I was shaving the yak recently when I though of creating a website for this book, then I thought to make it mobile friendly, create a dark-mode option and then do payment integration for the charity part. I thought all of this before completing the book. So, whenever you think of getting fit, don't set out to find the best pair of running shoes, apparel and or best gym in your locality. Instead, just start with something essential, something simple. 

Also, considering you really want to build a website, a simple HTML/CSS site would be enough.
But wait a second! Do you even need a website? Focus on the need of your idea. Don't shave the yak!

## Do the most important thing first

The best way to stay on track is to first do the 20% of the important work. In your MVP, code the most important feature first. There was no app that was feature complete on its release day. Think about any app you use today, and think about it 5 years back. You will realise that it has grown and more features have been added in those years. Hence, focus on the most used features because if you complete adding the most used feature, chances of releasing it increases. This will stop you from leaving the app half-finished.
While we talked majorly about apps, this notion can be extrapolated to anything you want to do in life. Use the momentum which you get while starting a new project, or anything else, to finish the most important things first. Know, that the website, the domain, the marketing, can come later. Understand the Preto principle is used for optimization in different fields and apply it to anything you wish to do. [more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

**Reminder :  Keep tracking your progress every now and then. The planning done and subtasks created under step one are of no use if you don't often check the progress**
 
>### *PRO*- Start
> Pull out your planning done under step one where you sub-divided your project into 1-hour tasks, now make few blocks  against each sub-task and track your progress. You can use color pens, emoticons or doodles to track and add extra fun.

## Alpha trumps gala

We all come from a generation where we are used to grand launches. We think that there will be a day when we will launch and everyone will just fall in love with our side project. Sadly, that day never comes. And even if it comes, chances are that you have missed on receiving early feedback on your project.
Shipping early and soon provides you very important advantages. It creates momentum and provides feedback. At Microsoft, we ship new features in an app to a controlled crowd instead of releasing it worldwide at once. This way we get the feedbacks and can make grand launches. You can do this too, release it to few of your friends or before doing a grand social media launch, launch it through DMs. 

## Last but not the least 

*Deadlines :* We have discussed this in previous chapters that deadlines trigger panic and is a way to overcome procrastination. But putting a deadline is also an essential part of project planning. Hence, always have a reasonable deadline for your projects. 

*Team :* An African proverb reads - "If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together". Similarly, if you want to ship something useful and big, start recruiting, start pitching and find your teammates. Teams help in the delivery more than anything else. It is plays a very important role in achieving productivity as well as maintaining it. We have dedicated a full chapter around teamwork and teammates. (#16 ).

*Delegation:*  If you find your teammates, you should, then learn to delegate. Delegation demands seeing the bigger picture.  Project planning leads to completion of project but one needs to say 'Yes' to 80% good delivery rather than trying to do everything by oneself. The day we learn this, our scale of delivery will increase multifold.
