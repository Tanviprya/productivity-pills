World famous motivational speaker and entrepreneur Anthony Robbins has quoted, "Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives."
When you will go through this chapter you will come to know why I have started this chapter with this thought.

In my opinion _'to use our subconscious mind efficiently'_ is the most useful productive pill we can use for making ourselves more productive. So we decided to reveal it in our last chapter.

As most of the common people state that, 'we loose one third of our productive hours in sleeping,' we should know that sleeping not only refreshes our mind and body, it also works as a tool to create a base for our will power to accomplish the work in our hand and thus help us to achieve our goal.

The research in this field reveals that our subconscious mind is more powerful than our conscious mind and it works for us 24Ã—7. When sometimes in our life, we just only plan to wake up early due to some important event and forget to set an alarm, most of the time we wake up just on time. It is just due to the power of our subconscious mind. Means we all have observed it's power without knowing the greater use of it. If someone really want to know the power of it and the practical uses of it's power in different aspects of our life one should read the world's best seller book on this topic with title 'The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind' written by Dr. Joseph Murphy.

I am quoting here three most useful and practical tips to make ourselves more productive.

1. Plan your next day before you go to bed. It is observed that as soon as you go to bed and start planning your next day's schedule and important tasks at your hand. It helps a lot to carry out the next day schedule successfully thus you use the time between period of going to bed and falling asleep really.

1. **Review your goal every single night** just few seconds or minutes before going to deep sleep, review your tasks of your previous day and evaluate yourself how much you succeed to go towards your goal. It also helps in rectifying the schedule for next day. It is also found that if you speak aloud your main goal of life or important goal at your hand at least three times, it gives a task to our subconscious mind to create new ideas to achieve it. In this way we use our sleeping time for achieving our goal and become more productive than others.

1. Train your subconscious mind to give **answers of important questions of our lives**. Many successful persons of different fields have revealed the secret during their interview or in their writings that if they couldn't find any answer to a particular question they just used to think upon it before going to fall asleep and when they woke up they got their answer. Even some of them got up midnight with their answer. Sometimes, it may take days, weeks or even months but it works surely.

The psychologists researching in this field conclude that the time when we are going to sleep is the right time to give tasks to our subconscious mind as it is the rest time for our conscious mind and our subconscious mind is going to lead in our sleep time with its mysterious power of imagination and dreaming.

By the way, I had also read about some successful people that they use to go for their sleep with some useful audio listening. So that the time before entering into the deep sleep may be utilised and our subconscious mind keeps working on it. Means we can conclude that if we want to be more productive, we should _use even our sleeping time for achieving our goals_.

I would like to ask some questions to you at the end of the book.

1. Why you choose to read this book?
1. Was your purpose to read this book was as clear as mirror?
1. What did you really want to learn, gain or achieve through this book?

If your answer is still not clear. If you are in confusion for any reason. Let me clarify it for you in one sentence.

> "Any of us read this kind of book, when we really want to feel more satisfied in our lives and trying to make it more fruitful and meaningful. "

Now, I want to add here further, 'if you really want to make your life more fruitful for yourself, your loving ones and society you should mainly focus on four aspects of your life i.e. health, wealth, relationship with others and inner happiness.' Now you shall be happy to know that not only all the above mentioned aspects but all the other important aspects of life could be get better through some easy and practical tips of using the power of our subconscious mind. So it's my prime duty to mention here most important practical tips which will help you in improving all the good aspects of your life. Before going through the points given below you should know two important facts. First our subconscious mind is very powerful and can create miracles in our life. And second which is more important and proven fact that we can influence our subconscious mind to create miracles by following some rituals consciously. Now, you can understand the following tips easily

1.  Remember that believe is the most powerful weapon of your subconscious mind. It can be created through constantly assuming what you really want but it should be supported by your efforts. First plan anything in your mind with positive vision and then put your effort on it. It will be more fruitful in all walks of our lives.
1.  Praying for anything for yourself and others in silence and solitude has been observed as a powerful tool to activate the energy of this hidden power. So whenever you get time in your life meditate for some time and pray for whatever you want.
1.  When we mix our power of imagination with our faith it doubles the chances of creating miracles in our lives. So you should practice to be more imaginary by dreaming clearly about your future. Try to dream and imagine consciously with full of your faith regarding what you really want in your future.
1.  Believe it, " Whether the object of your faith is real or false, you will get results." For example, I had read about an incident in a book about a person who was suffering from cardiovascular problem. He has fear of snakes from his childhood. Once he saw a string near his home in dim light. He assumed it as a snake. He became so scared that he got heart attack and eventually died. This incident proved that even a false believe in our mind can create a real result. So,if you create a good faith regarding anything which you desire in our life you will get real results.
1.  It is observed that unreal fears create negativity in our mind and that is the main cause of production of harmful hormones. So always practice to think positive about your future. Tell aloud that you are young, energetic and fulfilled in all the positive aspects of your life. Always use positive words about yourself with others and even with yourself.
    After reading the above points one could think, "It seems something like positive thinking." Yes it is. But it is real and fruitful. Some years before due to some circumstances in my life I had also caught by some negetive emotions and thoughts for a while, which had affected almost all aspects of my life badly. At that time my habit of reading good books and listening good speakers helped me to get rid of that situation easily and efficiently. I want to share here one important sentence of my favorite world famous speaker and enterpreneur Jim Rohn which helped me to adopt again the positive mindset. He had quoted, " Yes, I know positive thinking has no such power to do everything. But definitely it has the power to do anything better than what negetive thinking could do. "
    So, just be positive about all the methods and ideas mentioned in this book. Apply it for your fruitful and fulfilled life. We wish nothing for you but your betterment in all good aspects of your life. We have alredy done our best with good hope and all the good wishes for our readers. Now it's your term to spread goodness by sharing this wisdom with others as much as you can.

It is rightly said, " Nothing is easy if you are lazy and everything is easy if you are crazy. "

Remember it, 'reaching to a destination is the starting point of other.'

So let's become crazy to be more productive and achieve worthy goals of our life. All the best to all of us.
