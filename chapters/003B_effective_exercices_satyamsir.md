Three times elected Prime Minister of UK Edward Stanley had stated strongly, "Those who think they have no time for exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness."

I want to put here a real life example to illustrate the importance of exercise in our life:

Hall Enrold, a successful businessman and author of the World Famous Book 'Morning Miracle' suffered a major financial loss once in his life, suffering mental depression for a few days, he gave up his morning routine to exercise.
He made a call seeking help from his best friend in trouble and depression. During the conversation, his friend asked, "Are you doing your morning exercise regularly?" At first this question seemed strange, but then he realised his mistake and the next day he added exercise to his routine again. Within 1 week, he started seeing positive changes within himself. He started making better decisions and his behavior also became better towards others. Within a month, he also came to know the reason for his loss and in a few months again he became financially strong.  
He writes that after this incident, no matter what the circumstances are in life, he never allowed exercise to diverge from his routine.

## types of exercises

### Isometric Exercises

Muscle is said to contract isometrically when it's length does not change means there is no visible movement in this kind of contraction or exercise. During static muscular activity or Isometric exercises , the force  expressed by the athletes equals the force expressed by the resistance. Eg. - Push a concrete wall ,hold the sitting posture without chair , holding a weight on shoulder etc.Isometric exercises are beneficial in recovery from injuries.

### Isotonic Exercises

Isotonic exercises are exercises in which muscular efforts result in movement. In these exercises we can see the movement of an object on the application of force. Eg.- Lifting free weights such as dumbells, barbells and other weight materials etc. Isometric exercises are useful for training when muscular flexibility along with the gain in strength is needed most .

### Iso-kinetic Exercises

An Iso-kinetic contraction is a contraction in which the muscle contracts maximally at a contract speed over a full range of movement against a variable resistance. This type of contraction can only be accomplished with the use of apparatus such as hydraulic machine , mini - gym etc. Exercises like rope climbing , carrying weight , chin - ups , ice skating and some gymnastic apparatus exercises are some examples of Iso - Kinetic exercises.

## commmon principles of exercises

You should also have the knowledge of common principles of exercise, so that it could be easy to adopt it in one's daily routine. These are:

1. The Principal of Continuity: It means if you will not continue your exercise programme it will show reversibility.
1. The Principal of Overload : It means our exercise should be balanced in all manner. I will clear it and other terms related to exercise in this chapter separately.
1. The Principal of Individual Difference: It means your exercise should be according to your age, sex and body composition.
1. The Principal of General and Specific Preparation: It means you should have a clear goal in your mind about the outcome through your exercise programme.
1. The Principal of Progression: It means your level, frequency and intensity of exercise should be gradually increased.
1. The Principal of Warming up and Cooling down: It means there should be a small session of warming up before and cooling down after the vigorous exercise session.

## effects on your system

If you will continue your exercise schedule with following the aforementioned principles then apart from overall development in the fitness level the three major systems of your body i.e. cardiovascular system, respiratory system and muscular system will have the these specific effects:

### changes in cardiovascular system

1. Increase in the size of heart -- Due to exercise the heart wall grow stronger and thicker. It increases in size too.
1. Quick recovery rate: One who does regular exercise his heart rate becomes normal after vigorous activity quickly then a person who is not doing exercise.
1. Increased Stroke volume: One who perform regular exercise his stroke volume increases from 50-70 ml/beat to 70-90 ml/beat.
1. Increase cardiac output: The cardiac output of a general person who is not doing exercise remains 14-20 litre/minute but after doing regular exercise for 03-04 months it reaches up to 25-35 litre/minute.
1. Decrease in Resting Heart Rate: After following a moderate amount of exercise load for few months one's heart rate slows down from 72 beat/minute to 60-65 beat/minute in rest time because our heart becomes so efficient in pumping blood that it needs less stress to fulfill the blood requirements of our body.
1. Reduced risk of heart diseases: Regular exercise clears our blood vessels path and reduces the stress related hormones in our body which are the major cause of our heart diseases.

### changes in respiratory system:

1. _Increase in Tidal Air Capacity_ Tidal air capacity is the amount of air that can be breathed in and breathed out in a single deep inspiration/expiration. It is estimated at about 500 to 800 cc.
   After regular exercise it increases upto 1000 to 1200cc.
1. _Strengths diaphragm and muscles_ Participation in regular exercise strengths the diaphragm and muscles of the chest.
1. _Unused Alveoles become active_ Due to regular exercise passive alveoles become active. Thus lungs become more capable of filtering oxygen for the body.
1. _Residual Air Volume_ Residual air volume of the lungs increases due to prolonged practice of regular exercises.
1. _Increase in Vital Air Capacity_ Vital air capacity of a general person varies from 3500 cc to 4500 cc. It increases up to 5500 cc by regular exercise.
1. _Prevention from Respiratory tract diseases_ Practice of regular exercise prevents us from respiratory tract diseases.

### changes in muscular system:

1. _Muscle Tone_ Regular exercise helps our muscles in remaining toned position. In fact it remains in contracted position.
1. _Formation of more capillaries_ Due to regular exercise a number of new capillaries are formed for a better and efficient blood circulation.
1. _Change in connective tissue_ The connective tissue, which connects fibres, become powerful. It helps muscles to bear more stress.
1. _Change in shape and size of muscles_ Through regular exercise the shape and size of muscles increases. Thus it becomes more efficient.
1. _Efficiency in movement of muscles_ The movement of muscles become efficient and smooth. The movements during different activities becomes attractive.
1. _Improves reaction time_ Due to regular exercise, the speed of nerve impulses increases which ultimately improves the reaction time.
   _Increases food storage_ The food storing capacity is increased when regular exercises are done. This stored food can be utilised wherever it is needed.
1. _Body posture remains correct_ Our body poster remains correct due to tone up of our body muscles as a result of regular exercise.
1. _Non-functioning fibres become active_ When we perform exercise regularly, the non functioning fibres also begin to get active. Thus the strength of the body increases.

### positive harmonal changes

There are some positive hormonal changes too occur in our body due to maintaining the routine of regular exercise.

1. Dopamine. Studies have proven that regular exercise increases dopamine levels in the brain, which decreases stress and even depression. This chemical causes the famous “runners-high” because it enhances those “feel-good” transmitters.
1. Serotonin -- Millions of people suffer from insomnia and  sleeping disorder which compel them to use sleeping pills. Physical activity releases serotonin, which promotes a good night’s rest. Boosting serotonin levels can also positively impact mood, social behavior, appetite, digestion, memory and sexual function.
1. Testosterone. --A man’s muscle mass, strength, sex drive, and sperm count are directly linked to his testosterone levels. As a man ages, testosterone naturally decreases..
1. Estrogen. --The symptoms of menopause are in part driven by the imbalance and decline of estrogen. One way to combat this is to exercise. Getting your heart rate up for at least a half hour every day helps boost estrogen levels, which can help take the edge off of menopause symptoms.

## general benefits of exercise

Apart from these specific benefits one should also know general benefits of exercise

1. Exercise acts as our mood elevator. Exercise releases feel-good hormones called endorphins.
1. Exercise helps in fighting stress and depression. Exercises boosts our self-confidence and releases positive hormones thus naturally helps us in coping up with stress and depression.

1. It protects us from Diabetes and high blood pressure.

1. Regular exercise develops our mental skills. Nerve impulses works efficiently.

1. It helps to accomplish daily routine work efficiently and effectively.

1. It Decreases the risk of injuries. It improves resistance power against diseases too.

1. Maintains good posture: Exercise helps us to maintain our body posture by toning up our muscle and mood.

1. New research reveals that regular exercises have positive impact on hippocampus which is responsible for our memory storage. So it is obvious that regular exercise increases the ability to learn new things and boosts memory.

1. Regular exercise regulates our sleeping process. It brings good sleep naturally

1. Exercise helps us in maintaining balanced body weight.

1. Exercising in groups at gyms or parks allows one to develop friendship with others. It helps one in proper socialisation.

## exercise adherence

In spite of knowing all the benefits of exercise most of the people don't follow their exercise schedule. To deal with this topic one should know about the term 'Exercise Adherence'.

> "Exercise Adherence is the ability to maintain any exercise programme for a longer period of time or whole life."

For adhering oneself with regular exercise programme one should keep the following things in mind

1. _Goal setting_ Before starting an exercise programme one should create a proper visualisation in his mind. It should be kept as a picture in the mind as well as at the areas of your living room where you can watch it regularly specially at sleeping time and just after waking up in morning. It will help to keep oneself motivated for continuing his exercise schedule.

1. _Getting a personal trainer_ If you will take help by the specialist of any field you will be easily benefitted by his knowledge and experience of the particular field.
   It is easy to take a personal trainer these days through the help of internet facilities.

1. _Give yourself reward_ As I have described in the 'Procrastination' chapter giving yourself instant rewards and punishments help a person to keep you motivated. You can go through that chapter for better conception.

1. _Sometimes practice in a group_ For keeping your exercise programme lively, enthusiastic and motivating at least once in a week plan your exercise programme with your friends/neighbours/colleagues/family members.

1. _Keep a model in your mind_ You can find out a real life model in your mind. It may be among your friends, family, colleagues, or neighbours. For instant motivation you can keep an eye on him.

1. _Start easy_ The research also reveals that one who starts his exercise schedule with less than his exercising capacity generally tends to continue his exercise schedule more efficiently. So start with easy level.

1. _Keep variety_ To keep the exercise programme interesting one should include variation in his exercise programme such as different types of exercises with different equipments. Trainers also include different types of fitness training together for this purpose i.e. Strength training along with Endurance training or Speed training along with Flexibility training etc.

1. _Keep your training level at your personal level_ There is always a chance to get injured if one is trying to copy others specially in strength training exercises. If you will start comparing yourself with others during exercise sessions, it may not only distract you but also it works as a source of demotivation.

1. _Keep yourself in a optimistic group_ The pessimistic people are generally a good critic too. They always show you the dark side of all good works. So, if you want to continue your exercise schedule always surround yourself with the people of optimistic mindset.

1. _Self Motivation_ The last and the most important thing to adhere yourself to your exercise schedule is to know your motivation instinct.
   Just think what motivates you the most for living a fit life. At least think once about that if you forget to continue your exercise routine.
   You can also use some kind of motivational music during your exercise sessions to keep yourself motivated.

## some relevant terms

You should also know the terms related to Exercise Training for better understanding of the topic

## better usage of time

Now we have to discuss here how to use the time of physical exercise in better way. For general people who exercise for enhancing or maintaining their general body fitness, a mixture of 20 minutes aerobic exercises, 10 minutes light weight exercises (we can use our own body weight to fulfil this need ) and 10 minutes flexibility exercises are enough.

While exercising in place of using an alarm, I used to listen different kind of useful audios of the field in which I have to improve my knowledge or related to the project in my hand.

One can use some motivational music and videos too as per their mood. Start doing exercise at least 10 minutes from today, if you have not started yet. It will not going to kill your time but it will make you able to become more productive for doing your other daily routine work efficiently. It improve our memory and boost our mood too.

30 to 40 minutes of systematic exercise sessions at least 5 days per week will help you lead a happy and healthy life. It improves the total functional capacity of an individual to perform a given task.

The Hindi Doha which has inspired me a lot for continuing my exercise schedule in my life is, _"Dukh mein sumiran sab karen, sukh mein kare na koi. Jo sukh mein sumiran karen dukh kahe ko hoye."_ It means, it is better to start our daily exercise programme when we are healthy. So whatever the condition you are facing in your life, do start exercising from today. Start from easy and entertaining exercise programme according to your mood and capacity from today.

All the best to everyone for adopting this healthy habit in their life.
