# for God's sake! put down your phone..

We all know that phone eats our time like nothing else in this world even then we keep using it. Why? Answer is because we have got addicted to it.
Our brain’s internal wirings have changed which craves for something novel every five minutes. This has affected our ability to concentrate, learn something effectively or do meaningful work.
Tell me if you can relate to one of these behaviours:
You can do any work only under duress. Meaning you work only when there’s a deadline is approaching or you have to update status to some authority.
The moment you try to learn a new skill or concentrate on something and it gets boring your hand automatically (without even you realising it) goes for your phone.
You get in a lift/bus/public place/queue. You know you’re going to wait for like 2-5 minutes (max) and your hand reaches your pocket to get your phone.

I know this happens. This happened with me all the time until I started looking at it through my mind’s eyes. I now see folks glued to their screen everywhere. Even in social gatherings people can’t help but check their phones every so often.

## digital detox won't help

So what do I do? I realised this last year while reading research on productivity. Like everyone out there I thought of doing a digital detox. The one where you announce your departure on social media and delete all the apps from your phone. Did that work? No! Then?

## physical separation helps

I started doing **this simple trick** when I have to work with complete focus like in office or when I am doing a course or writing something. Basically anything which demands my utmost attention, I do this. I switch off the internet on my phone and keep it away. In office, I keep it in my bag. At home, I keep it on the bookshelf physically away from me. Try this and you’ll be amazed how good the saying, “Out of sight, out of mind” is.

## what about calls?

One good thing about 24x7 connectivity is that people don’t call unless it’s a real emergency. Use this to your advantage. You know that you won’t miss out on anything which is needed. For work related pings, communication is key, by which I mean, I have told my managers and colleagues this same thing that my internet will be off when I am at home so if you absolutely need to reach me then call. They understand that everything else will be replied next day tomorrow during work hours. It also helps to maintain a healthy work life balance and is the key to my productivity at home. Bottom line is: Lose your phone to do your best work.

## few ideas to help

See, we did discuss that we can't cut ourselves from the outer world in order to be productive. But there's one thing which we can do. We can be mindful about it. Instead of giving Internet the power to distract us whenever it wants, we can use some methods to connect when we want but stay disconnected unless an active effort is made. Few things which I do.

1. **StayFocused Chrome Extension:** Since our primary work is on the browser, yup! I am a web developer, I can't just uninstall the browser. However, there are plugins which would stop you from unknowingly wasting your time on Reddit, Twitter or places like that. The lure of social media and the novelty it offers is such that when you start using it you don't know when to stop. You can use these extensions to keep you focused, configure it to give you X amount of time in a day.

1. **Active Zen Hours:** Practice staying away from the Internet for a couple of hours everyday. Especially if your nature of work involves staying connected. You'll be avoiding a lot of mental troubles down the line. Set hours aside during weekday and weekend and do anyting but stay away from the internet. We have lived millenia without net, we can manage few hours.

1. **Decluttering your desktop:** I think it's been more than 12 years since I had an icon on my desktop. When you have a game, a book, a file, a movie and all the one hundred and one distracting things right when you open your computer, chances are that you will click on one of those. Don't fight yourself all the time. Rather remove the temptation. Remember the shortcut keys, these days the search is pretty great too. If you search for "terminal" you won't get "angry birds" as result and you can quickly launch into work.

1. **Write on Paper:** No matter what you use if you open a computer do some serious writing work, chances are that you're going to get distracted. I have a separate account on my machine which always has zero office related apps installed. So, whenever I have to write, I just log into that account. However, writing on paper is still better coz even if you feel like going over the internet, you can't. Bonus! It's good for your eyes, it's good for your brains. Things you write on paper are etched into your brain much better.

1. **Switch off your notifications:** Actively manage your push notifications. See, I have thousands of followers across social media channels, if I keep it On every few minutes there will be a notification saying someone commented. Now, it's hard to find the urge to not go and look into the comment. Whether it's a good or bad comment, your brain wants to know. However, the point is even if you have a decent social media following you will have this problem. My solution, switch off the notifciations. People who want to reach me, have my number. Only whatsapp has notifs ON. All other apps have off. Try it, trust me you're not going to miss out on anything. This #fomo culture has compelled us to miss out on our true potential.

1. **Stay away from group chats:** Oh! I saved the worst for the last. Group chats are the worst form of communication invented since I don't know when. Anyone can trigger a communication at anytime and everyone then feels compelled to say something. The worst kinds are family whatsapp groups and office group chats discussing something. I have so many issues with group chats that if I start writing about how it's destroying our civilisation it will become an essay in itself. But to be concise, save yourself from this abomination. If you are added to a group chat where you can't leave, simply mute. If anyone on LinkedIn, or any other social media says, "hey! I am creating a group for X professions, comment yes, if you like to join", you never comment "Yes"! There are better ways to network and stay updated than wasting your time on group chats. Find better ways, save time and elevate your productivity.
