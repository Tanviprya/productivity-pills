## opening with a dream sequence

A friend of mine once told me about one of his dreams. He told me that he had gone to a very big stadium to watch a football match in his dream. The stadium was full of spectators because all the famous players of the world were going to play match between them, dividing themselves into two teams. While one side was led by his most favorite player Lionel Messi, on the other hand the other team was led by his friend's favorite player Cristiano Ronaldo.

Shortly all the players gather in the middle of the stadium. Along with all the spectators, he also stands and greets all those famous players with applause. The players of both the teams are standing in the middle of the field with full enthusiasm. The referee comes and shakes hands with the captain of both teams and tosses. After the toss, the referee indicates to the players of one team to stand on his one side and the other team to stand on his other side. The players follow this order with full discipline. There is a point in the middle of the field where the ball is placed and the game starts duly. The players of Messi's team cleverly move with the ball and pass each other, but only then they focus on the design and marking of the field.

They see that there is no edge in the ground and round type marking has been done in that round ground. At last the most important thing was that there was no goal post anywhere. Seeing this, my friend get into thinking that what will be the result of my favorite team which is taking the ball in such a better way and presenting their best team spirit? After all, on the basis of which the decision of winning and losing this match will be made ? And what does it mean to see such a match? He says that after thinking all this, the excitement of watching my matches is over, I run away from the stadium and my sleep opens.

## messi will mess up without a goal too

After listening to his dream, it struck me that as the way the best players in the world and their best team can neither play an exciting match without goalposts nor entertain people in the same way. If there is not a definite goal in our life, then despite all the talent, our life is meaningless. For more concern just read the given below statement.

”When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.”
-- By "Maharshi Patanjali, Yog Sutra"

I think the above mentioned quotation is sufficient to tell everyone about the importance of setting a goal. The more SMART goal you have the more energetic, enthusiastic and agile you feel. It is directly proportional. But clarity is must.

## what are smart goals

In this chapter I am going to clear the principle of this widely accepted concept i.e SMART goal. First let me expand SMART.

- S means “Specific”
- M means “Measurable”
- A means “Achievable”
- R means “Realistic”
- T means “Time bound”

### specificity is the key

So, first your goal should be specific. It should be specific in different aspects of your life. As I think, our life has basically five aspects:

### physical and mental health.

Relationship management (with friends and family)
Economical (acquiring knowledge and skill regarding how to earn money)
Social (how to use your skill and ability to make the society better)
Spiritual (to search meaning of life and inner peace)
Now, first let your goal be specific in these five above mentioned aspects of your life.
can you measure it#
After specification of your goal, you have to keep in your mind that it should be “Measurable.” As, we have discussed earlier about five aspects of our life. At least there should be a comparable criteria in your mind that how far you have reached the goal and how far you have to go. Your role regarding achieving these goals should be well defined and should have a measurable quality.

### impossible missions are good for movies

After making the goal measurable . It should be “Achievable.” If someone is making a goal without taking a proper step and planning, it is simply unachievable. For example, if I will make a goal - “I have to become the physically and mentally strongest person in the world.” It is neither achievable nor measurable because one can be best in one or two criteria of competition but never in all. So, you should keep this principle in your mind while framing your goal. After matching your goal with the quality of specificity, measurability and achievability, you should fix realistic goals too. If someone is fixing a goal - ‘To pluck a star for someone special.’ It is good to imagine but not realistic. I do not think you need to know more about it . So simply your goal should be realistic too.

### timebound

And last but not the least, the most important part of achieving and fixing your goal is- ‘It should be time bounded.’If you really want to change your life with the power of your written goals or if you really want to achieve the worthy goal of your life, it should be divided into three phases:

- Short term goals (Achievable in one week - one month – in some conditions it may be on daily basis).
- Mid term goals (Achievable in one month to one or two years)
- Long term goals (The goals achievable in two to five years – or sometimes more than that) If we have well divided our long term goals in clear short term goals bounding it with fixed time to complete it, this will really do miracles in our life.
