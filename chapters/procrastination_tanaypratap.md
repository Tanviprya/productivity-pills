# procrastination

## introduction

I think we all agree that this is the biggest problem on the path to productivity. We all want to do more, start new things, finish the started ones but this comes in between.

**who is this chapter for?**
Do we all suffer from procrastination? Yes.... and No! I feel there are three categories of people. Let's see where you fall:

1. _procrastinate no matter what_ They don't care about the deadline, if they don't feel like working, they won't. It's okay for these folks to fail in exams. After all what are exams? A structure created by society to exploit these creative souls!

1. _procrastinate till panic hits_ They delay their assignments till the last moment, their studies till the last day of exam.

1. _what's procrastination_ These are the toppers, the planners, they will be found in the library even during normal days, preparing for the exams coming after a month.

If you fall in the third, you don't need this chapter. You're already doing your best. My advice to you is that you don't push yourself more. Rather prioritize your work better, don't signup for too many things. Also, take care of your health and social life.

If you fall in the first, this chapter won't help. Unless you understand that when you sign up for a system you have to respect the system and not revolt against or game it. I was in this bracket for sometime, honestly, so I know how it feels. It feels that the stakes are too low to care for that deadline, that test, that exam. However, this attitude soon becomes a habit and an excuse to be lazy. The repurcussions of failure at small tasks start mounting and cumulatively you are far far away from where you could have been in life. So, for you my advice is to come to the second bracket.

I fall in the second category right now. This chapter is for folks like me. We do work on things when the deadline is near. Get into intense focus mode and close the task. So, if you are in this category, you are good enough. But you do need help at one point. Doing something outside the job.
what if you wanna do more? this is where you write books, create podcasts, or create YT courses, work on side projects or learn new things. Whatever your side hustle or growth plan is, if it's fizzling out after office hours, then this chapter will help.

## motivation is fleeting

Many a times, I get this question, "How do you find motivation to do all this?". I understand where the question is coming from. It's hard to get yourself working after a tiring day at office or college. But the question in itself is wrong. I'll explain why.

We think that to work more, to work hard we need to listen to some motivational speaker (and that's how they're running their shop). You watch a video and you feel motivated, but after few hours that motivation fizzles. Motivation is cheap, work is not. To make something worthy you need to put in constant work in it. This leads to half baked projects. Then what is the solution? There are three things which will help:

1. **Discipline** I don't know how people define it. For me it's simple. If I have decided that I will write a blog after coming from office, I'll do that. Or, if I have decided that I'll be in office 8AM everyday for years together, I'll be there. This sounds hard, but the good part about it is that once you get into discipline you're basically taking away choice from you. Your will power doubles and that's when you start achieving things which from outside looks impossible. Read more on will power in Satyam Sir's version of this chapter.
   Next thing is, how do we decide what to be disciplined about?

1. **Routine** When I was young(er!), I read quotes about how routine kills creativity and what not. There can't be something farther from truth. Routine means that you don't need to decide every hour what's the next thing you want to do. Whether you would like to have breakfast, or wait for lunch, or wake up at 6AM or 10AM. When you free your brain from these menial decisions, your brain can focus on the more important, i.e. the core tasks. It also fights procrastination. Once you have a routine that everyday, 2 hours after office, I will sit and write/record, it is just so easy to start doing it. Again, don't give your brain the choice on the menial decisions. You must be thinking now, "Oh! This sounds so robotic! I don't want to lose control of my life, I want to be in the decisive chair". Okay! but you don't need to decide every menial thing every day is it? So, when do we decide?

1. **Prioritization** Now, here's the thing. Define a cadence. Weekly, monthly, quarterly. Every week sit for an hour and decide what you want to work on this week. You'll see lots of thoughts coming up. Then ask yourself what's the one thing you want to work on this week. And work on that only. Even if you have discipline and routine, and you bite more than you can chew, you're setting yourself up for failure. Don't do that, more on that later in this chapter. So, every week, or every , early in the week or day, decide one task. Put it in your routine. Define exact time for it. Start small. Define 30 minutes to 60 minutes max for the project you have been meaning to work on.

> Key to productivity: Never set yourself up for failure.

If you take a pen and start making the routine now, get the resolve to follow it with discipline and then prioritize only one thing you want to do after office/college then it can be done. Discipline plays the most important role. If you have decided to come out of office at 5PM, no matter which party your colleagues are going to, you come out.

> Productivity needs sacrifices, learn to make it.

- overwhelming tasks
- the two minute trick

## small wins

As we talked in previous section, a major reason why we procrastinate is that the task seems overwhelming. We talked about the two minute trick. But that trick works only when you have done some good planning ahead. (see the planning chapter for more). To make sure that you can get productive as soon as you start, you need to sub divide your tasks into chunks. For example, when we started writing this book, we thought we'll write everything we know about productivity and thus we were noting down ideas but couldn't write a lot of chapters. Then one day we both got on a call and decided that the first version of the book will have the 10 best ideas we have. I chose 5 and Satyam Sir chose 5. Now, we had clear goals, we had to write 10 chapters. I then went on and created mini notes for the chapters I wanted to write. With the research and planning work divided and closed, the actual work didn't seem overwhelming. To write one or two section everyday was 30 minutes of task. And slowly, day after day, I wrote my 10.

> Laps feel easy than completing the stretch?

**celebrating every win** Here's one more thing which we did. Which I think you should do no matter what you're working on. Celebrate every milestone. Whenever we completed one chapter we posted it on our whatsapp group. The other person and our editor would read it, congratulate on completing 10% of our work. It felt great. Instead of looking forward to completing the book _one fine day_ we started looking forward to complete _one chapter_ and sharing and celebrating it. Every chapter I completed, I shared it either with close friends, or on my personal instagram. It just made me feel good. I broke it even smaller and we'll talk about it in the next section. Of all the things, I have done, writing this book had been one of the hardest, but breaking into smaller and smaller chunks and celebrating every chunk made the whole journey a delight.

> Celebration helps in visualization of the finish line. Next time your lizard brain will not get afraid of starting.

**having a reward** While I say that good work is its own reward. I see that many folks recommend having a reward system for completing every task. This is something I don't do, never tried. However, this might work for you. If you like to eat something, watch a TV series, read that favorite novel. You can delay your gratification and make it a reward to complete the task.

## solve the energy problem

Sometimes the problem is far from the lizard brain. There are times when you're actually tired and you can't make your body move to do anymore thing. There are tiring days in office, there are just bad days in life too. And that's okay. As long as you're _mindful_ about your energy state, I feel it's okay to say, "hey! I did enough today, let me have a break".

> It's okay to take breaks every once in a while, but if it's daily maybe you're not operating at 100% energy

However, if this is a repeating pattern. Maybe your energy levels are down. 8-9 hours of office work or college classes shouldn't drain you every day. And if that's happening, I strongly recommend getting some exercise to get your body oxygenated. We all feel bouts of energy after good exercise don't we? Use that time to do the thing you're procrasitating on. Taking care of your health is important because it controls your energy levels to do more things. So, if you find yourself drained constantly, having no energy whatsoever to work on your personal growth check your: body, sleep, food. More on this in the effective exercise chapter.

## a word around teamwork

- all I have done is because of a team
- social media can be a team too
- live session
- giving someone a deadline makes it real and deadline panic monster takes over

## streak is the biggest reward

- personal examples
- 1 year of fitness
- writing streak

- key is to have visible progress.
  - tracking is super important.
  - this is where gym or weight loss fails.
  - Project the progress away from the real deal.
  - Patience is key

## procrastination is good for creativity

- Give your examples around talks and YT lives.
- Adam Grant Originals
- don't procrastinate on the work, do it on the final output

## using procrastination as a signal

- knowing your strengths and weaknesses

  - I can code anytime
  - But writing needs more mental energy

> E.B. White once [wrote](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/03/lifetimes/white-notes.html): “I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.”

- this is around side projects. Make it a delight. You shouldn't start something which you absolutely dread just because someone else is doing it.
- same for job, if you're smart, and you love your field, there's a job out there which would truly excite you (if not everyday) most of the days.
