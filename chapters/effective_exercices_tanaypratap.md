# effective exercises

Growing up I was not the most active kid. I got computer at a young age and video games and other stuff became my goto agents to take a break. Which in hindsight worked out well. But there comes a time in every young boy's life when he wants to look fit and bulky. It came in college. It was easy to be in shape in college coz had to walk everywhere but as soon as I came to Bangalore, in few months it was pretty clear that if I don't something I'll end up 100+ kgs.

I was eating everything as I had so much money now. And I had a job which required me to sit for 10+ hours a day. So, the journey started to stay fit and thus I joined a gym, office gym, coz it was free and everyone used to go there. What entails below is my journey of fitness and how things and thoughts have changed over the years. Let me tell you that I am not a fitness expert, however, your mind and body works together to make you productive. Even a slight pain in body can render your mind distracted.

> Over the years I have perfected my approach towards fitness to make me more productive without having to do a lot of stuff.

## outlive everyone

Why should anyone want to be fit? Most of the problems which arise due to unhealthy lifestyle can be alleviated with modern medicine right? Yes, it's somewhat true that you can pop a pill for any issue today and you won't have that pain or fever again. But every pill you pop decreases your life expectancy. The way I think about fitness is how I think about compound interest.

See, some of the guys went to IIT, I couldn't get in. But what I have done over the years is that I don't smoke or drink. Now they might be making a little bit more money than me now but most of the way they go most of them will retire by 50 or be dead by 60. You can only take your body so far if you don't care about it. However, the way I think about it every year your salary compounds by some percent. And follow that math you make most amount of money in 50+ time. You can see the VPs, CVPs, in any big tech company. They're at this age group and they make the most money.

> Basically, if you play the long game and outlive everyone you win!

## avoid falling sick

There was a time in my career I used to stretch myself beyond limits. I would work hard. Code for 20 hours in a day. This is the time I was doing some freelancing along with my regular job. As I was making money by the hour, I was putting more hours. And then I fell sick. And I was bed ridden for almost 4-5 days. When I got better I researched on why we fall sick. Turns out that pathogens are always attacking you, however your immune system keeps fighting. But your immune system goes down when you don't get enough sleep and rest. So, by now you know that I think of health as an investment right? So, I calculated. Whatever extra hours I had worked during the past two weeks got equalised by not working for 4 days straight. Plus the feeling of being sick.

Why did I tell you that story? So, that you don't make this mistake. Working hard, hustling, all of this sounds cool. People tell you stories about how they were working on all night for that startup that raised X amount of funding, but on an average they lose out by falling sick. Also, the quality of life increases when you get your body proper sleep and rest. If you're thinking about cutting on your sleep, please first cut down on watching Youtube videos, TikTok, Netflix or whatever you're watching. Optimise your time for sleep.

## the goal

So, you see, armed with this intelligence and realisation I started going gym. But going to a gym daily is hard. After a long day of work, you want to relax and not push yourself again. And I'll tell you why? because you have limited amount of will and going to a gym takes a hell lot of will power.

> If going to gym was easy, everyone would have a six packs and biceps like Henry Canvill

And then I asked myself the question which I feel you should ask if you're going to gym. Is the goal of your life to build a muscular body? For me it was there for sometime, if I am being honest, but then I realised it's a lot of work. With the regular workouts, the will to push yourself, the sore muscles, the wear and tear, the diet and the upkeep.

And the worst part is this, it's not a long term investment. What I mean by that is the moment you stop going to gym your six packs start disappearing your muscles are lose again and your biceps are gone. I personally don't like to invest in such things. So, I went back to thinking. Thinking about fitness again. Coz I knew one thing that fitness is not optional.

> Gym from an investment point of perspective gives very diminishing returns.

## garbage in, garbage out

Talking about investments, there's one thing which is a great investment when it comes to fitness. Creating a habit of eating right and eating light. Now, I have been experimenting with my food for a long time but when I left gymming I didn't need to to so much protein. Now, the thing about protein is that it takes a lot of time to break in your body and wastes a lot of energy.

We are knowledge workers, we don't need strong arms and bulky chests. What we need is constant supply of energy to our brains to get most work done. There's a reason why in Hindu way of life there's different food for different professions. People who used to do the work of brain would eat light, carbohydrate heavy food. While people who used to defend and fight, would eat protein.

This thought has stayed with me over time. I have been studying about it and experimenting on myself. I have cut my diet in 1/4th of what I used to eat in college now. And I have been pure vegetarian. I try to eat food as fresh as possible. And I don't drink tea or coffee, even though I have a podcast named teawithtanay :).

Has this diet helped? Yes, tremendously, since my body has to do less work trying to break food, I have more energy in my brain. Earlier I used to sleep for 9 hours and still after lunch I would feel super sleepy, that is gone now. I don't need as much sleep either. I think the most important part is since I am not eating a ton of extra food, I don't need to spend a lot of time to burn those calories!

> Advice: Experiment with the quantity, eat to live, not live to eat

## sports

Play. Anyone who's been serious about studies in India stopped playing at 14-15 years of age. The moment board comes you stop playing, then competitive exams, then college and then job. When I got into job, and figured out that gym is not that exciting, I asked myself, "What's something which is exciting, doesn't hurt my eyes, and will keep me fit too?" And the answer was simple: Sports. And let me tell you, I was bad at everything. But the good part about being bad at everything is that you can get trained. So, I did. In past 8 years, I have taken professional training for badminton, swimming, cricket, tennis, table tennis, squash. I have equipments for all of this. I have put money behind it. And I have loved every part of it.
Sports has kept me fit since 2013, I haven't gone to gym since. And I have got better at all of this. I didn't know any of these things, so learning new things outside work gives you even more confidence.

> You know the biggest thing about sports is that you never have to look for motivation.

I mean isn't it true? When I was a kid, waking up at 6AM for school seemed impossible. However, waking up at 5AM for gully cricket during summer vacations was totally okay. I am sure you would relate to this? Just that somewhere between the dreams of IITs and placements and then finding another better/higher paying jobs, we lost our will to play. If you can take one good habit out of this book, I would say start playing! You don't even need people these days, every big city has professional trainers and dedicated coaching for this.

## some side effects of indulging yourself in sports

Apart from keeping me fit with zero effort there are other major benefits which I observed of having a sport in life. One definite thing which you'll realise is that you start looking to the end of the day. What happens when you start working is that you work way too many hours. There's no point going home. There's no one to go home to, your flat would be stuck in their jobs. Might as well stay in office and chit chat and do some work. This has several negative effects. If you don't have a clear deadline you will never finish your work in 8-9 hours of office time.

**culture change** This creates a culture where people are working late at night and project themselves as hard working. Trust me you can fool your boss, but you're actually harming yourself more than anything. If you don't know how to close your work in the specified time your productivity has gone for a toss! I am talking about all of this from my personal experience. The moment we started playing everyday, our water cooler chats cut short, no gossips, suddenly everyone worked well during the core hours. This helped the people who do have families as the day closed for everyone at specified time.

**making friends** when we started playing badminton and posted photos online our group grew. Long last school friends joined. Colleagues brought their room mates to the game. We used to hang out after game and made good connections. People who play after office are generally quite productive. You can take it as an early sign of success. Creating a network helps. And sports has emotions: you win and lose. When you share emotions with someone your bond gets stronger. Here's a simple trick, if you want to be good friends with someone, check out what sports they play and join them for few sessions. You still remember your friends from childhood with whom you played.

**creativity** We will talk about diffuse mode as a method of learning in detail. However, sports has one big advantage. Your creativity soars. Your priority sorts itself. Many things which bogs down your mind during the day goes into background when the shuttle or ball is in air. In that moment you are totally present. This boosts your creativity. You learn to cut down the noise and focus.

**about watching sports on tv** Last thing which I want to say is, I don't watch T20 or any sports, I feel better use of my time is that I play it. Watching a sport only helps the advertisers. Professional players watch a stroke once and practice it 10000 times. You're not going to be professional, and if you're planning to find a coach before TV.

> Watching sports on TV provides as much benefit as running miles in Temple Run

## walk if nothing else

There will be days when you won't have time to play. It's 11PM at night and you were busy with something. Or you have to get on a call, or check on your Dad's health on phone. Here's what you should do: walk while you talk. Our body is biologically tuned for walking. The moment you start walking your body feels at home. It's great exercise. For two reasons: there are no injuries, and you need zero motivation/equipment to get up and walk. So, whenever you feel like doing nothing, walk at least.

**supercharge your walks with podcast** You know why I got into podcasts? There were two reasons, the primary one was that my eyes got bad about which there's an upcoming section. Main thing which kept me hooked to podcasts was that those are real productivity boosters. Think about this: you're tired after a long work day, but you need to give your body some exercise. So, you decide to walk. Now walking for an hour alone could be boring, and there are only set number of people you can call and talk all the time. So, what do you do? You start a podcast. Podcasts are extremely casual conversations where you feel like you're part of it and thus you enjoy it. Good part about it though, is that you do learn something or other every day. Think of it as a virtual hangout with experts of your field. And I talk about the benefits of hanging out with the right people in detail in consuming the community (#15 ).

**walking as a meditative thinking exercise** There's a different kind of meditation which I do when I walk. When I am thinking about a course, or a podcast to record, I start walking. And I keep a blank sheet with me. Then I keep my mind focused on what I want to teach or speak and points start flowing. Whenever something pops, I make a short note. If my mind tries to run here and there, I nicely ask it to think about the problem in hand. This has helped me come up with amazing content. I think this is because it lets the mind relax and retrieve at the same time. And while walking you have nothing else to do, so might as well come up with some ideas for a talk, course, blog, podcast or anything. Don't do this all the time, but whenever you're due on a long writing assignment instead of sitting and mapping down the points, first take a walk.

**once a week, walk in a park** We have made ourselves plugged into our phones or laptops all the time. Even when we take a break we watch a movie in closed space. Understand little bit of evolution, all of this happened very fast, like in last 50 years. But our body, brain, gene is not designed for this. We were designed to be in nature. There have been numerous studies which shows that just by looking out of you window and seeing some greenery relieves stress. Therefore, every week, on Saturday I go out for a walk. There's a beautiful lake near my place with forest around it. I do 10kms every time. And my God! that gives my brain all the restoration time it needs from week long productivity work.

> If nothing else it will make you a much happier person.

A recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3520840/) proved that your creativity increases multifold if you spend time outdoors in the nature. Well! I know that the future is of knowledge and creativity and I don't miss out on it. Thus, my suggestion make a habit to get out and sit/walk in a park every week.

## yoga and meditation

This is something I am nowhere near an expert. And I started this very late in my life. 2018 is when I got into Yoga seriously. And 2020 is the time when I learnt to meditate properly. I'll tell you one thing from my experience till now, it heals. It heals your body, makes it flexible, increases endurance. Every occupation has an occupation hazard, programmers, students and knowledge workers today have to sit for long hours in order to do their work. This results in number of joint issues and flexibility suffers. Yoga, I feel should be mandatory for us if we want to go long.

With meditation, you get peace, focus and most importantly answers. I can not explain these things, I read Bill Gates blog on meditation and even he wasn't able to explain it so well. So, here's what I will say.

> Starting Yoga and Meditation so late in my life, the only thing I wish was that I should have gotten into it earlier.

By now you know how I think about fitness as an investment. I think Yoga is the best investment. It's the GOLD. Coz even if you stop doing it you will always carry the positive effects of it forward. The parts of body which the asanas heal will not go back the way it is just because you stopped the practice. You have to again do active damage by eating wrong or something else to go back.

## checkups and supplements are okay

I don't know about you, but the way most of us are raised our mothers will take offence if someone suggests a supplement. Which is actually good. We are raised to eat vegetables and fruits which provides us everything. Also, in middle class families, we don't go to a doctor unless something is serious!
Now, this book is training you to get ready to make leaps and bounds in your career by being productive. So, first of all get out of that mindset that you're young and you don't need a checkup. See, I'll tell you. We are not getting home cooked meal anymore. We hardly have anytime to eat fruits leave alone cook vegetables.

**thinking about money the right way**
When you come from a lower middle class family, your first instinct to a problem is to sit it out and let the body heal itself. Which is fine when you're young. But think about this, if you're sick one extra day you lose one day of salary. When I started my job, I did the calculation, one day's salary was close to Rs. 3K. I could instead go to a doctor pay him 200-400rs and make sure that I don't have any long term issue.

Now, extend this thinking to health checkups as well. Since we are not getting the right diet, and we are overworked sometimes, also not getting the sun, we do lose some important nutrients and vitamins. It creates lethargy, depression, sickness and in turn affects our productivity. A health checkup would ensure that you have everything, and if you are short on something, you can take a supplement. Or you can add that vitamin rich food in your meal. But if you don't know what the problem is, you can't solve it. And one day you'll be sick enough to lose all the money (in time, coz otherwise we have insurance) you were trying to save.

> Learn to spend money on your health. That's one of the best investments you can make in life.

## tracking your progress

Do you remember Satyam Sir talking about habit? (link to distraction chapter here). He explains really well the part that cue plays in forming a habit. So, I was once diagnosed with water logging in my legs. I checked with a doctor and he said that since I sit for long continuous hours with my feet down this happens. His solution? Walk every hour for few minutes. Now, here's the problem, and serious programmers would relate to it. We don't like moving. Especially coz when we are coding, in the zone, in the flow we forget about time. What did I do? I bought a fitness tracker. It has sedentary alert which makes me walk every hour. So, that problem is gone.

The other good thing about having a tracker is that I have a log of how much walking I have done during the day. I try to maintain 10K steps of average over the week and 6K steps daily minimum. Remember how we talked about streak being its own reward (link to tanaypratap's procrastination chapter)? This tracking of walking and physical activities have made me vigilant about my fitness. We love data, and data tells me how active I was over a week or a month and I know that I have to make some hard decisions if I am not giving enough time to my health.

Now, many friends bought the tracker and you might be on the amazon page right now, but remember tracker can't make you move. It's your resolve to give your health priority which would make you move. Tracker can only act as a cue, as a nudge, you need to learn to act on that and form a habit out of it which would keep you healthy.

## taking care of your eyes

In all my journey towards fitness I missed out on one critical aspect of working with computers. In the year 2019, I was working very hard, during the office, after office creating courses and answering questions on chat. And it took a toll on my vision. It started blurring and watering and I got shit scared to be honest. I ran to a doctor fearing that I might be losing my eyesight, and yes I am that dramatic. However, it turned out that it's a simple case of computer vision syndrome. Turns out this is a common problem with techies.

Let me explain it to you. Our eyes are designed to look at things which reflect light. Not at the source directly. That's why we don't look at the sun, or the bulb in a room. However, there're few thing which are self illuminating and we do keep looking at it constantly. Yes, that's your computer screen, phone and tablet. The bigger problem is the blue light coming out from these screens because it strains your eye the most. Think of it as looking at noon sun vs evening sun.

So, what's the solution? Few simple tricks and my eyes are much better now. Sharing it here so that you can follow those.

1. Turn the night light on all screens. Yes, for full day. It will look odd for sometime but then your eyes will get used to it and it won't feel weird.
1. Use hardcopy books instead of reading everything online. I know how ironical this sounds coming from an e-book. But wherever you get a choice, go for the hard copy.
1. Amazon kindle or e-ink readers are okay to use. They don't create these problems.
1. See, the best way is to stay away from your phone as much as possible, save your eyes, save your time as well. Tune into podcasts and give your eyes some rest.
1. This one's the most important: 20-20-20 rule. This syndrome occurs coz we focus our eyes on something in close distance for a long time, which strains the eye muscles. You do feel your eyes relax when you look at moon or mountains, it's because you don't have to focus. So, here's the rule.
   > Every 20 minute, look 20 meters away for at least 20 seconds.

## conclusion

Oh wow! This chapter is long. It's because I am trying to tell you my journey and the options available to you. Do I do all of the things I talk about? No! I certainly don't. However having options mean that I do end up doing some yoga, some walk, some sports, some meditation every week. And I keep tracking my movements through the tracker.

So the most important take away is that if you really want to be successfully productive in your life you need to take care of your health. There's no other alternative.

> We have all got just one body.
