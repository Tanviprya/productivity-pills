## Story time

  

Once, a courtier asked his king, "Maharaja, how do you maintain such a great balance between personal and social life?; How do you manage to focus on a particular task when you have so much on your plate?"

  

Maharaja replied, "I will definitely answer this question. But, first you must take a test.” The king asked for a bowl full of oil and told him, "You have to take a round of the entire garden of this palace within half an hour. While taking the round, you are completely free to enjoy the sight and aroma of the beautiful flowers in the garden. Just remember, my two soldiers will be following you with their sword and the moment a single drop of oil spills from your bowl, they will separate your head from the torso."

  

As directed, the courtier took a round of the garden with the oil-filled bowl ensuring not to spill a single drop of oil and returned within stipulated time. He was brimming with happiness on successfully completing the task. But to his surprise, the Maharaja commanded, "Please enlighten all the people in this court about the flowers and their fragrance". Hearing this question, the courtier took a pause and answered with a heavy heart, "Maharaja, my entire focus was on the bowl and returning in time, so I could neither see the flowers nor smell them. So please, pardon me. "

  

Maharaja smiled and said, “I did not send any soldiers after you. I wanted you to realise that you were completely focused on the oil bowl and to return in the limited time, nothing could distract you neither the absence of soldiers nor the heavenly fragrance of the flowers. Similarly, whenever I work on one aspect of my life, then I keep my entire focus on that task at that particular moment. I always try my best to live life in the present. This has also helped me to maintain balance in my social and personal life and is the main secret of my health and happiness."

  

This story highlights the importance of attention and focus in our lives. If we really want to live a healthy, happy and successful life we should always practice not to get distracted while doing any task. We have discussed attention in our 'Attention Management' chapter. Whereas, this chapter is solely dedicated to one of the major sources of distraction in today's life - 'The Smart Phones'.

  
  

## Your brain is tricking you

  

The smartphone revolution is one of the most important events in the technological space since the beginning of this century. On one hand they have made our lives so much easier, but on the other they are the killers of our productivity. They can even increase inattention, cause headaches, lead to shortness of temper, cause sleep disorders and depression. Researches suggest that when we are being noticed and appreciated by others, the nucleus accumbens in our brain activates, providing us a sense of satisfaction and pleasure. It is the same when we eat delicious food, make love or feel successful in life. Our brains become habituated to such happiness and demands for it repeatedly. That's why we are always tempted to go through our social media notifications to seek validations for our activities and therefore, it becomes difficult to keep ourselves away from smartphones.

## The replacement protocol

  

Studies show that quitting the habit of using smartphones, excessively, is similar to quitting other addictions like smoking, alcohol consumption or gambling. When we become obsessed with something, it acts as an obstacle to lead a fruitful and productive life. If you want more knowledge on forming and quitting habits, read the bestseller book- 'The Power Of Habit' written by Charles Duhigg. In short, every habit formation is based on this cycle of actions:

  

1. _Cue or trigger:_ You get a notification and automatically your hand reaches your phone.

2. _Work/activity:_ You check your notification

3. _Reward:_: You get momentary gratification for checking that notification.

  

Once, we understand the actions that lead to the formation of our habits and subsequently an addiction, we can try to stop it at the start by being conscious of the cues or triggers.

  

Let’s focus on the simple solution to this dreadful problem of smartphone addiction. The best way to change any unwanted habit is to replace it with the new ones.

  

If we could control the cue or trigger, then we won’t be performing the activity our habit warrants. But still, our brain has been trained to expect rewards and therefore, we should have alternative activity-reward mechanisms in place.

  
  
  

## Few tricks to control your triggers

  

- Turn off the notifications in your phone settings

- Remove distracting/useless apps from your home screen.

- Use flight mode while doing important work.

- Put your phone away while taking rest.

- First try to keep your smartphone away consciously for a few hours, increase those hours gradually into days or weeks accordingly.

  

The above mentioned activities will only work on controlling the triggers like notifications. Make sure you need to fill that time with some interesting activities like playing musical instruments, doing exercise, painting or anything that will help in replacing the gratification or pleasure you attain from using smartphones.

> Go to your mobile settings and turn off notifications for all your social media applications. Do this now.

At last give your mind the similar rewards, share your achievements on social media so that your mind feels better and rewarded and has the incentive to perform this newer and more productive habit.
