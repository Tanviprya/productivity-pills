## do you get semester breaks?

Since my childhood, holidays exclusively meant 'a Sunday's affair'; be it during my school days, college days, even currently in my job as a teacher at D.A.V. Yes, it is also true that I have been getting lengthier vacations since my school days such as summer vacation, winter vacation and post-exam holidays which later turned into semester break. Even today, I get about ten to forty days of vacation at a stretch in my teaching job. So, like Tanay, I am not able to take any advantage of my weekends but I make sure to utilize my bulk holidays to the hilt into improving myself.

That being said, my suggestions in this chapter would be useful especially for students who get semester breaks after their exams or similar such breaks. Well, if somebody really wants to be in the process of betterment, he/she can always take a break from their job and execute some of my suggestions. To explain the chapter efficiently, I would be bringing up three short stories from my life which has proved helpful in improving myself. You can easily relate to the events.

## finding myself through meditation

The first incident is of the summer vacation of 2002 wherein I stayed for a few days at my elder brother's ashram in Delhi. In nearly twenty days, I experienced a lot of changes on a spiritual level within me. For the very first time, I participated in group meditation, group dynamics and other different types of spiritual activity. Along with my elder brother, I met other spiritual people there as well. I also got the opportunity to live there in a quiet and secluded environment. Today, the sense of spiritual peace and bliss that I carry, a large part of its contribution is courtesy to those twenty days.

It helped me to remain untroubled in difficult situations of life and to keep myself buoyant. Drawing upon the experience of this vacation, I would suggest everybody that whenever in life you have this chance to go solo on a long vacation, you should choose to stay with a similar spiritual group and experience Yoga, asana, pranayama, meditation, etc. collectively. Alternatively, you can always choose a small yoga and meditation-related course if possible. And of course, if this course happens to be under the patronage of a qualified teacher along with the grace of nature, certainly your experience would multiply.

## the introspection of what next

The second incident that I would open up here should more aptly be referred to as the emergence of a new kind of thinking than to call it an incident. I was sitting quiet and lonely in the games room at my school after the final exams of 2008. I was confronted with a thought that I have been teaching students of class XII for the last eight years even though I did not have a master's degree in my subject and this was wrong as per the rules. Another thought that crept in was that now I had two ways to spend my life. The first one being the easier one, which most teachers take up is of considering the job that they have got to be their destiny and live all of their life accordingly or the second one which is a bit difficult, but thrilling, exciting, and full of joy is to choose to keep trying to improve oneself. After much consideration, I decided to choose the second option of pursuing M.P.Ed. to improve myself, being completely aware that for this I would have to remain unpaid for 18 months and spend almost all the money I have saved while working in the last eight years.

Perhaps, it was only for the ability and courage to make such difficult decisions, that I find myself different from other people today. I would also like to mention that my family's financial situation was not so good when I got my B.P.Ed. degree in 1999 to further allow me to continue my studies. So, I joined in as soon as I got the job. To study again after leaving it for nine full years was not going to be a cakewalk. I took it as a challenge and I feel overjoyed and proud to tell you that I made it to the first rank. While completing M.P.Ed., I spent the summer vacation of 2009 with my family, which is one of the most memorable holidays of my life, one from which I have learned a lot, and thereby I have mentioned it here as the third incident.

However, after that tough decision in 2008, except for 2009, I have utilized all my holidays either reading or learning something new. If I hadn't taken the difficult decision to pursue M.P.Ed at that time, I would neither have obtained my Ph.D. nor would I have qualified UGC NET. Apart from this, I also completed many other small courses during my holidays which increased my knowledge and confidence considerably. It was only while working that I represented the Jharkhand Senior National Volleyball team twice.

## resolution must be absolute

Based on this whole incident, I want to convince you that if you want to use any of your vacations properly be it small or big, you must first decide to improve yourself with full resoluteness. Remember one thing, whenever you go for a job interview, they do not care about how much you need the job, rather they care about how capable and useful you would be for the job. And it goes without saying that if you want to succeed in life, keep trying to make yourself competent and skillful. According to where you want to see yourself in the next five years, keep small courses or other useful seminars and workshops pre-planned for every small and big holiday. Keep reading books according to your goals and maintaining notes of whatever you learn, which would eventually become a tool to recall a whole book in minutes.

## family trips

The third incident that I would like to mention here is about the trip that I made with my family to various hilly areas and pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand. Two of the main pilgrimages being Kedarnath and Badrinath. To visit the main temple in these two pilgrimages, we had to ascend to the high mountains, where the temperature and other conditions were in no way native to us. There was extreme cold in those high altitudes and none of us knew anything about staying in such cold weather. Well, we completed the entire journey of Kedarnath on our foot. My elder son Nitya was only three years old at that time and I carried him on my back for about seven kilometers of the journey.

This journey helped in strengthening us physically and mentally more than before and also worked towards increasing our willpower. We encountered several indelible moments throughout the course of our travel. Whenever any of us got sick, we all responded in harmony like a good team to provide strength. We stopped at many places on our way which we had not planned beforehand. As soon as someone expressed admiration about a place on inquiry or if we liked any place, we would have our stopover there for some time. Even today when I recall that trip, those moments spent with nature and family fill me with joy and excitement. We experienced a blend of both fatigue and adventure during the mountaineering. This journey unknowingly taught us a lot.

Based on the experience of this holiday, I feel that if you want to spend some time with your family which is full of thrills and priceless experiences and one which strengthens your determination, then you must do something exciting like in my case taking up an adventurous trip with family at least once in five years. You can choose among any of the beautiful natural places for this purpose.

## some more ideas

Apart from these incidents, I am sharing some tips for those who want to make the most of their weekends and holidays so that, it seems more relevant to this chapter's title.

1. You can clean or adjust your home and surroundings -- It is said by a great Indian poet Nida Fazli, "Apna gum le ke kahin aur naa jaaya jaaye. Ghar me bikhri hui chijon ko sajaya jaaye." It means one should not go out of their home with their sorrow and anger, rather one should decorate their home. It is psychologically correct. When you clean and decorate your surrounding it has a good impact over you. You can try it for a few hours of your weekends.
2. Plan to spend a good time with your family and friends -- It is said, "Ankh se door na ho dil se utar jaayega. Waqt ka kya hai gujarta hai guzar jaayega." It simply means 'out of sight, out of mind'. Why we really want success in our life? A wise person will answer, "To enjoy my life with my family and friends and to become more useful for the society as well." So in the process of success don't forget to spend good times with your family and friends at least once a month.
3. _You can try some new kind of exercise dose suitable for your body_ If you have already read the chapter on the exercise you know why it is so important and how to apply this method. If you haven't read it yet, go give it a read and after going through that chapter it will all be clear to you.
4. You can write a blog/article/story/poem on some new interesting topic or can complete such stuff if you have started one -- Creativity keeps your brain agile and alive. It makes your life more meaningful. So I suggest, if you had planned to go for a trip or somewhere outside but due to extreme weather or any other reason you had to cancel it, just shift your time and energy to write about some new topic or complete the incomplete ones.
5. _You can update and rearrange your social accounts_ Like the third point, I am not going to explain here about the cause, method, and importance of this. You should read the chapter about the importance and use of social media for your success.
6. _You can spend time searching and applying for new jobs and making your resume more effective_ If you have a job and you are very much satisfied with that in all aspects then this point is not useful for you. But research data shows that more than 80% of the people are not satisfied with their jobs. Make use of the weekends and apply to all the suitable posts for you and always try to make your resume more effective as it is your first impression on the HR and selection board.
7. _You can plan to spend some extra time with yourself_ It is said that "If you are not meditating and if you are not spending quality time with yourself you are missing on meeting the most important and valuable person in your life."
8. It is also said that _"The man has to burn alone and he will die alone. The rest all is a drama."_ We shouldn't miss the opportunity to spend a good time with ourselves especially when we are to ask some questions to ourselves. You can spend some hours or even a full day in silence and solitude for your inner growth as I have mentioned earlier in this chapter in the incident when I was at my elder brother's ashram.
9. _You should take time to plan the next week_ If you want to be more productive you should spend time in planning and scheduling work and projects that have to be completed in the coming weeks, well in advance. As it is said, "Proper prior planning prevents poor performance."
   There are many more things which you can do according to your area of interest during the weekends but always focus on the worthy goal of your life while planning and using your weekends.

Good wishes to all of you for spending the rest of your weekends to the best.
