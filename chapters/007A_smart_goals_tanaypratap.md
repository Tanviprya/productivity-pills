## the problem

Don't we all have a lot of half finished projects in our repositories? Domains bought for those ideas? We start building something with great enthusiasm, create the repo, create the website, start coding. Then after few days we abandon it. Why? While there are multiple reasons to abandoning something, the major one is lack of planning. Let's discuss steps to better plan and deliver things you're working on. Whether this is a personal project or in office. These steps will help.

## first things first

Before we begin getting into the planning mode, let me state something which I feel is an essential skill for delivery. "The ability to subtask is the most underrated skill". You will see that a lot of managers who are really good at delivery, they can break the problem into smaller problems and then break again, and again, they can go iteratively small. I have seen and worked with some such managers during my tenure at Microsoft. It made me understand what made these people successful in their career. But for further discussions, remember that if you can break a task into tasks of 1 hour, it can help in execution speed as well, as it fights procrastination as well. (#17 )

## learn to respect the skill, the tools

Project Management is as much a skill as programming. You know how you can't be a good programmer without respecting it. Similarly, you need to respect this as a science and as an art. It has its own challenges and there's a reason corporations pay managers such hefty sum. Respect is the first step. Second is, learning the tools of the trade. A simple kanban board, specification writing, delivery tracking are enough to get you started.

## is it really required?

I feel that the first question which we should ask ourselves when starting something is whether there's an actual requirement for it. If you're creating a project for learning, then make sure that learning that skill is essential. If you're creating a project to solve a problem, step one would be to do some research and see if a tool already exists, and if not why? Understand that though the idea seems novel at first, there's no novel idea on the planet. Everyone has thought of everything. So, do your research. Ask yourself, whether you really want to build it? And then ask this question again after the next step.

## define scope

Once you have done some research around the requirements, write down your idea in a one to two page document. Clearly define your goals, the features it will support in the first version. What's the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) spec looks like?
Now, you have got some idea of what you're signing up for, ask the question in the previous section again, "Do I really need to build this?"

## don't shave the yak

So, you think about a building an app. You think hey this definitely needs a website. So you go out and look for the best thing out there. You come to know about something called Gatsby. You say, yes, let's use this, everyone is using it. Gatsby uses GraphQL, so now you learn that. Spending weekdays and weekends to understand new tech and resolving errors. You see how far you came from actually programming the app, solving the real problem? That's what we do, we get into the details of things which is put you farther away from the goal. For this book, I was thinking of creating a website, then do payment integration for the charity part, then make it mobile friendly, then dark mode. And all of this before completing the book. What I am trying to say with my personal anecdote here is that it happens with everyone. And in everything, we think of getting fit, we set out to find the best pair of running shoes, apparel and what not. Instead, we should start with something essential, something simple.

If you think about the website, a simple HTML/CSS site would have been enough.
But wait a second! why do you even need a website?

## do the most important thing first

Do the first 20pc important work first. In your MVP, code the most important feature first. Think about any app you use today, and think about it 5 years back. It has grown, more features have come up. No app was feature complete on its release day. While this is all about app, this can be extrapolated to anything you want to do in life. Especially for personal projects, chances are we will lose the steam soon. But if you have done the most used feature, chances of releasing it increases. Use the momentum which you get while starting a new project to finish the most important things first. The website, the domain, the marketing, can come later.

**Here's your reminder to keep tracking your progress every now and then. The planning done and subtasks created in step one are of no use if you don't often check the progress**

## ship your alpha, beta, v1, v2

We all come from a generation where we are used to grand launches. We think that there will be a day when we launch and everyone will just love our side project. Sadly, that day never comes. And even if it comes, chances are that you have missed early feedback on your project.
Shipping early and soon gives you both these advantages: creates momentum and provides feedback. What we do at Microsoft is we ship new features to a controlled crowd instead of releasing it worldwide at once. You can do this too, release it to few of your friends. Before doing a grand social media launch, launch it through DMs.

## deadlines and teammates help

Deadlines trigger panic. This is one way to overcome procrastination. Talked in depth at #17 . But putting a deadline is essential part of project planning.

"If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together" - An African Proverb. If you want to ship something nice and big, start recruiting, start pitching. Teams help the delivery more than anything else. There's a reason I have put an entire chapter to it(#16 ).

The most important part here is learn to delegate. A bigger part of planning is to say Yes to 80% good delivery rather than trying to do everything yourself. The day you learn this, your scale of delivery will increase multifold.
