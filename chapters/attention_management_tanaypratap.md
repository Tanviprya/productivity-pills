# attention

## a story for good gpa

Let me tell you a story. there is a close friend and let's say his name is Mayank. Mayank was a topper in college. He would get somewhere around 9.5+ GPA. And he was not a meritorious student all his life but suddenly transformed into this person. From 7.5+ GPA in first few semesters to 9.5+ in later ones. How did he do that? We wondered? We thought he might be good at mugging up stuff and dismissed doing that in college. He was talking to my sister before she was going to college and she was asking for tips. I was a passive participant.
He said, and I quote, "I rarely studied after class but I found out that almost all the questions in exams come from what was covered in the class. It could be sometimes on the board and sometimes a passing reference from the teacher just before sessional exams to drop a hint." And then he continued, "I figured that I can't ditch the classes then might as well pay attention to what is being taught". And that's it. He made a choice which made all the difference.

## the choice is yours

When you're listening to a podcast, or attending a conference, or seeing a tutorial, or forced into a meeting. There are always two choices: the first and easy one is to zone off and all students are trained at that. The other one is hard but it comes with practice. And then when you learn to pay attention to hard and sometimes boring things you utilise all this time.

## a simple trick

To say that I have perfected this would be an exaggeration but I do try to mindfully practice this. One trick if you are getting bored or sleepy by a lecture is to start taking notes. You will see that suddenly your posture changes and you become much more active.

Rather than allowing distractions to derail you, you choose where you direct your attention at any given moment, based on an understanding of your priorities and goals.

> Focus is a valuable resource that’s constantly under attack.

- attention is scarce
  - we are not made for multitasking
- giving attention makes you happy as human being
- time management is medieval,
  - everyone has 24 hours, how do you get your edge?
  - trying to get more out of every minute/hour
    - productivity comes from the word "produce"
      - industrial/agricultural term
      - but we aren't machines, we are knowledge workers
      - tracking by the hours: wasted hours vs. productive hours is futile
    - narrow your focus, and attention will surface
    - is the problem
    - will decrease quality of work
  - do not focus on more than one/two things in a day - do one thing, and do it well - when office is routine, w
    -knowledge workers should strive for attention management
- attention in personal relationships

  - when you're with your family/friends make the most of it
  - no point in being the super productive person in life, if you aren't attentive to the needs of your loved ones.

- flow isn't mythical

  - “being in the zone”
  - loosing the sense of time
  - when doing a task is its own reward
  - how?
    - distraction free environment
    - incremental wins: relate this to programming ( ability to break down tasks into smaller manageable chunks, recurring theme in book)
    - difficulty of task relative to skill
      - increase skill, (read, prepare in smaller chunks, do research) or
      - increase difficulty
    - benefits?
      - internal bliss
      - boosts of productivity

- deep work

  - look at book summary
    - knowledge workers are in demand
  - your best work comes out of it
  - removing distraction
  - pods and places designed for deep thinking

- in office

  - block hours on your calendar for focused work
  - having core overlapping hours help
  - getting to office at 8AM (even during lockdown)
  - get a room, to avoid shoulder taps, or use a visible sign

- how to manage attention
  - one thing I learnt during meditation
  - you don't need to force it
  - you need to be mindful about your mind wandering
    - the moment your mindful, your attention starts answering to your will
    - let it wander, cause you need creativity too, while writing a blog/book, your mind needs to form thoughts, so it will wander, just be mindful of it.
  - my favorite part
    - read a book
    - social media has degraded our ability to pay attention
      - we need everything under 280 characters
      - we hardly read essays, research papers. all our knowledge is from "blogs"
      - when you only pay attention in short span your mind gets bored soon.
