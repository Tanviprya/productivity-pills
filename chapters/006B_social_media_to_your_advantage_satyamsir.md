We all are dependent on each other at all the level of our necessity. It starts from physical and ends at emotional and spiritual needs. To understand better how social connection can help us to make us emotionally balanced in tough situation in our life and help us in making our task easier I am sharing here an important incident of my life.

## through thick and thin

On 01 October 2012 I received a letter from the office of my school. As soon as I read that letter, the school which was mine for almost 12 years, I used to think day and night about the betterment of the school, where I had close relationship with teachers, students and other staff. They all started feeling as unknown in an instant. Actually, that was my transfer letter which was totally unexpected for me. My transfer was in a school named DAV Chiria, in West Sinhbhum district which was about 300 km far from my previous school DAV Public School Kathara which was in Bokaro district. There was no direct route to reach that school. To get there, three times vehicles had to be changed. But since I could not get a better job than that at that time, I had joined that school with a heavy heart. There was only one means of staying connected with others to me was my mobile. Internet data charges at that time were much higher than today. Yet, since I was away from my family there and I did not have any special project in hand, I decided to connect with people through social media. During that time, many new friends were made and many old good friends were found through Facebook. Some good friends who helped in the last few years when needed, some of them were connected to me only through social media and the most important thing is that my transfer to this area again was possible through the help of this mean. There was a special contribution of social media in it. The mobile number and address of those persons who played the main role in my transfer were received by my social media friends only. This does not mean that my family's contribution was less in difficult circumstances. No one can replace their contribution, yet I want to say that we can use social media wisely for our betterment. By the way, I use social media to share my happiness, knowledge and new skills with my betterment. One of my famous words that I speak mostly to my children is, "Goodness must be spread. " and social media helps me to spread my goodness in the society.

But as there are pros and cons of every thing there are some drawbacks of the use of this social media. It sometimes hinders the effectiveness of direct relation with others, promotes making false image, unreal competition and show-off.
These days, we are communicating less and spending time with our friends, family and society directly due to the change in our lifestyle, nature of work and technology. We have become habitual to communicate our skill, wisdom and emotions through social media. So it is necessary for us to know how to use social media for enhancing our productivity.

## to connect connect with friends and family

I think there should be a specific group in WhatsApp or Instagram for our friends and family separately, where you can share your feelings and situation with them and vice versa. It will help in establishing the bond of relation with each other. We should also respond to the posts published by them in other platform of social media, if we are connected there too. It also shows our care about them and help each other grab others attention.

## to create your own community

If you want to create your own connectivity with others for your own benefit you should keep posting the knowledgeable and factual posts of your specialisation. With passage of time you will get attention of the people who are of the same mood.

You should create your accounts on different platforms of social media and connect them to increase the audience from different platforms. You should also work on win-win theory for increasing your connectivity by going to others platform and inviting others to your platform of social media. This connectivity will also help you to grow in different aspects of your life.

## to upgrade yourself

All the experts of different fields are interacting, guiding and teaching through different social media platforms. You can use your free time to connect directly with the experts of your field to take lessons and learn by their experiences directly by them.

In this way, you can use this social media in positive way to make yourself more productive with entertaining and refreshing yourself.

## conclusion

It goes without saying that social media is an unavoidable part of our life nowadays. It is consuming lots of your time. But, if you will use this wisely it can help you to enhance your productivity too.
