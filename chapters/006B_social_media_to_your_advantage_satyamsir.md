We all are dependent on each other for every necessity. It includes our physical, emotional and spiritual needs. In the previous chapter, we discussed on the tricks to take advantage from the 'media' in 'social media'. Whereas, in this chapter we will focus on the advantages of the term 'social', be it in any sphere of life. I am going to share an important incident of my life to highlight how social connections can keep us emotionally balanced and make it easier for us to handle difficult life situations.

## Through thick and thin

On October 01, 2012, I received a letter from my school's office. While reading that letter, I started feeling dejected. The school, for which I used to think, every day and night, for last 12 years and where I had close relationships with the teachers, the students as well as the staff members, felt distant to me. The letter talked about my unexpected transfer. I was being transferred to another school situated at Chiria, in West Sinhbhum district which was 300 kilometres far from my current school. One has to change the transportation thrice to reach that school as there was no direct route. The situation at hand was unanticipated and upsetting. I knew that I could not get a better job in that short time so I joined that school, at Chiria, with a heavy heart. After joining at Chiria, leaving my friends and family behind, I realised that the only mode of communication was my cell phone. Internet data charges were very high during that time. Yet, I decided to connect with people through social media during my leisure to overcome my loneliness and isolation. That was a good decision as I found new friends and got back to the old ones. The relocation during the transfer was made possible by the friends who connected to me online. They shared numbers, contacted their friends and helped me at every step during those despairing moments. I had support because I chose to use social media wisely.

> Take a minute and think about a time when social media helped to handle or deal with a difficult situation. Do not hesitate to share your story with your Pro-community and spread goodness. (tag @tanaypratap on twitter or Instagram with #procommunity #myTnTstory)

## Choose your side

I continued using social media and nowadays, I use it to share my happiness, knowledge and new skills. I believe and often tell my students that, "*Goodness must be spread*." and I see social media as a beautiful mode to spread our goodness in the society.

But we know nothing is perfect in this world and social media is no exception to this rule. I do appreciate the connectivity it provides, but sometimes it hinders the effectiveness of direct relations with others, promotes false image of someone and leads to unreal competition. Nowadays, we have become habitual to communicate our skill, wisdom and emotions through social media. We rarely communicate or spend time with our friends or family in physical world. Hence, it has become a necessity to be mindful about our social media usage.

## To convey your love to F&F

Choose to instil emotional stability and to be there for your loved ones. I suggest that there should be a specific group in WhatsApp or Instagram for our friends and family respectively, where we can share our feelings and talk about experiences. It will help in establishing the bond stronger. We should respond to the posts published by our closed ones, without fail, in other social media platforms. It is a sweet way to communicate our care and attention.

## To create your own community

Choose creation and betterment. You should post or write blogs or create anything exhibiting your specialisation. Subsequently, it will create your connection with others in the same field or with same interests.

You can create your accounts on different social media platforms and connect them to increase your reach. You should follow the win-win theory and increase your connectivity by inviting and attending seminars, sessions, lives at each-others platforms. The community will help you to grow in different aspects of your life.

## To upgrade yourself

Choose knowledge. We can say that knowledge is free and flowing in this digital era. The experts of different fields are interacting, guiding and teaching through different social media platforms. You can use your free time to connect directly with them to take lessons and learn by their experiences.

## Conclusion

It goes without saying that social media has become an unavoidable part of our life. It is consuming a lot of our time. But, if we will use it wisely it can help us to enhance our productivity too.
