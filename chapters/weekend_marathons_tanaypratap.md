# weekend marathons

Of all the things shared in this book, this one has helped me the most. However, to achieve this I had to use all the other chapters. This is something which sounds easy to do, and not that hard to do, but if you do it, you'll produce amazing results.

## once there was a newbie

This was 2019, I was in Microsoft and working on a repository which mandated 90% test coverage. Which means the programs you write need to have tests no matter what. All my career, I never had to write tests, so I didn't know anything about it. If I can be honest with you, it was embarrassing to code the feature in a day, and then struggle to write proper test. That's when I decided that enough is enough and learnt testing over a weekend. And I became so good so fast that fast forward a year, 2020, I am writing testing best practices documentation for my entire group.
Even before this, I have deployed this technique multiple times. Once to learn Deep Learning when I got a project in Cisco. That too was pivotal in my career. The respect which you get when you learn something overnight is monumental. People think you're super human! As with every chapter, I am going to share this with you, my dear reader, so pay attention.

## it all connected when I read Deep Work

If you read the preface of the book you're currently reading, I talk about how I don't read a lot of productivity books. How I don't even know half the terms or scientific backings. I experiment with myself and do what works. So, I have been doing weekend marathons whenever I needed to summon my inner God of Learning. However, last year I read this book: Deep Work. And let me tell you, the book by Cal Newport is an amazing book! I swear by it. It validated a lot of my hypothesis and experiments. Particularly the weekend marathon one. The book talks about how you need to think about something 2-3 days continuously without interruption to form deep neural pathways. And that's when I understood why this technique has worked so well. That knowledge and this technique instantly connected.

## you don't need 10,000 hours

I'm sure if you have read any productivity or hustle book it would have asked you to dedicate 10,000 hours to be great at something. I say, you don't need that. And I will tell you why:

- First of all it's impractical. In today's world you have to learn so much, you can't spend 10K hours on everything. If we have taught anything to you in the previous chapters it's that you need to have realistic goals. (see the smart chapter by Satyam Sir)
- Second you need that rule for one skill. For your core skill. For me it's programming, for Satyam Sir it's volleyball. For you it could be anything. Spend your 10K hours only on one skill. For other skills, read ahead.
- As we grow in our career, instead of being an expert at one or two things, being expert at one and being good at a lot of other things count. If you have read the book Startup of You by Reid Hoffman (highly recommended book btw) it talks about the intersection of skills and how that makes you unique. Basically, you need to be an expert in programming, but you need to be good at product, communication, devOps and a bunch of other skills. If you're reasonably good at other things, it adds a lot of value in your career.
- Last thing, the 10,000 hour rule research came from studying elite pro level athletes and performers. We are talking about the Vishwanathan Anand of Chess and Tendulkar of Cricket. So it doesn't apply directly to knowledge workers and office going folks. The intersection of skills makes more sense for people like us.

## all you need is a weekend (a long one)

When we were in college we had all the time in life and nothing to do. When I started working, I realized there's so much to learn and so less time. Luckily, we do get some long weekends. Sometimes you get a Friday off, or a Monday off, and many of my friends would explore Coorg or Goa during that time, while over that weekend I acquire a new skill.
Let me tell you how:

What you see above is a learning curve. You see how it's so hard to climb the curve when you don't know anything? But if you see it from a positive perspective it also says that you don't need a lot of time to climb the curve. What you need is intense focus and a lot of deliberate learning practice. 24 hours i.e. 8 hours per day over a long weekend can make all the difference.

## prepare

- **sleep** Like anyone who has run a marathon would tell you, "it begins a night before". Don't think that you will go to party, and put tons of crap and alcohol in your body and then next day you'll have the energy to run a marathon.
- **reading/learning material** what are you going to learn? where are you going to learn it from? Do you buy the shoes on the day of marathon? No! right! Then why wait to look for the resources on the internet on the day of learning. Prepare yourself well. Now, here's another important thing, like how you don't decide which shoe to wear on the day of run, please don't bookmark all the courses and material for the day and then start looking for which one is the best on the day of learning. Identify what you will be reading or going through in advance.
- **divide and conquer** - See! any topic is endless. You can't learn all of it in 24 hours. So, you need to divide what you want to learn before hand. Break the topics and see what is most useful for your knowledge. Recently, I went through the spec of HTML as a marathon and I failed. Why? I thought I can go through entire spec in 3 days. My learning, overconfidence on your own ability is counter productive. So, decide the top topics. Have an estimate. A 3 hour course should ideally take 8 hours to take notes, quizzes, and do the programming exercises. Keep the first day to basics.

  > Plan well, plan ahead, plan convservative.

- **take care of the essentials** You don't cook food while running a marathon. In a similar way, plan for your food etc ahead of the day. I generally go to Microsoft. We have 24\*7 food and snacks there, internet, A/C and a distraction free environment. Moreover, I get into nice clothes and the mindset to treat this as a regular office day, eliminating choices. This ensures that I'm in a space where I have a habit to concentrate. Do plan this well. I remember when we were in college we used to go to our A/C library for entire day and had only Cuppa Noodles.
  > These are the parts where you have to take an idea which worked for me and apply it in your environment
  > but understand that environment plays a big role in your productivity

## start running

- **remove distraction** During a long learning day, distraction is your biggest enemy. So, do prepare for it. Tell your friends that you won't be available this weekend. Don't check Instagram Feed to see your friends traveling or eating at some restaurant, or worse going for that movie you also wanted to watch. Success demands sacrifice. Easiest way is to not see what others are doing.
- **only 8 hours** Remember that slow and steady wins the race. Don't spend all your energy on day one. This is a marathon not a sprint. Especially because your brain needs active deep work hours and then break hours to break and consume that information passively. 8 is the limit. So, take a break after that. Relax and enjoy your night. Hey! but don't overindulge. Remember, race is still there.
- **deliberate practice** is the key. While I will talk more about it in the next chapter i.e. effective learning techniques. Understand that if you are planning to write the same program or similar program for 24 hours this will not yeild any learning. If you want to make the most of it, increase your learning difficulty level every few hours. Solve questions which tests concepts from previous chapters as well. This is why you need to do your research on the learning material. A good material can get you started quickly but then increases difficulty level to give you more in less time.
  Let me give you an example, when I was learning testing that weekend, I started with the most basic examples, then started learning jest, then tried their tutorials, slowly I started writing tests for my own toy projects, then started reading production code from heavily used Open Source repos.
  > Key is to challenge your brain slowly,
  > not too fast that it gives up
  > and not too slow that it feels bored.

## push and finish

- **commit to 24 hours** After the first two days, two things will happen, and I am speaking from experience. First thing is that you will start feeling good about yourself that you have made progress. Second thing is that you will feel tired, you'll make excuses to yourself, "hey! It's office tomorrow!", "I do deserve sometime off after office, don't I?", "let's resume this next weekend?". Don't give in please. As we talked earlier 20-24 hours or 3 days of deep thought will cover the distance from "noob" to "reasonably good". If you give up now, you go back to zero. You won't have enough confidence to call yourself good, neither you will have enough energy to pick it again. This is important. Not giving up on 3rd day is the key.

## the recovery routine

You know there's a post marathon routine which helps your muscle gets into shape and recover better. Brain too is a muscle. And after the weekend marathon there are few things you can do which will make sure that your learning is effective.
Before saying anything, you might be thinking that hey we have done 16-20 hours of continuous learnings before, for exams, but we are no where near good in that subject, in fact scored a B, and forgot everything in a year. Do you relate to this? If yes, this happened because you did two things wrong. First was that you crammed for exam which helps in immediate retention but not long term, more on that in effective learning techniques. Second and most important is the recovery routine:
The recovery tip post marathon says that wait at least 6-8 hours after the race to stretch and at least 24 hours before going for a massage. You know what massage does? It induces pain to heal.
Anyway, how can we relate this to our learning marathon?

- First of all don't go back to the material for first 6-8 hours. Stay as away as possible.
- In fact your brain has worked hard, give it a break, maybe watch movie or go to social media. Give it rest.
- Let your brain forget what you have read for 24 hours.
- After 24 hours, massage your brain, which means try to recall. You'll have some pain but this pain is good. Give yourself 30 minutes and just list down few points which you remember from the marathon. Then give another 30 minutes to go through your notes. Do both in this order only. The first 30 minutes will give work to your brain, obviously it will forget something. The second part will then come in and cement the information. And this way, we learn and become "reasonably good" in 24 hours.

## btw don't wait for a long weekend

You can create one yourself. Any half decent company gives you 25-30 days of leave in a year. If you have been following the advice in exercise chapter you might never need the 10-12 days of sick leave. And if you're dedicated to early success in your career you can even use the rest of 15-18 days of Paid Time Off. Many of your colleagues and friends would be doing that. Taking an extra day off near a long weekend to create a 4 day weekend to go on a trip. You can choose to create a 3 day long weekend anytime you feel like mastering something.
I feel that one of the biggest mistakes we make in our career is that we limit our learning and mastery. First we do that by adhering to college curriculum, blaming it for not giving you enough time to learn anything else. And then we do that for office, saying that the project I am working on sucks, or there's no learning in the team. Let me end this chapter by saying that use this trick to be master of your own learning trajectory.
