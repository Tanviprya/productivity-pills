As we all know the concentrated ray of sun can burn a paper. It is all about the power of concentration. but I will explore my view to the topic with a small incident of Mahabharata.

When Dronacharya the great teacher of his times what teaching archery to his students, he once asked them to shoot a bird on the tree by aiming it's eye. He called them one by one and showing the bird, he asked them what they saw while aiming on bird's eye. Everyone except Arjuna said that they saw the tree, the branches etc. with the eye of the Bird so everyone missed the target except Arjuna. Rest we all can learn a lesson by this incident that though Arjuna could concentrate on the birds eye so he shoot the target properly and efficiently.

## krishna says

As I started this chapter with the incident of Mahabharata I would like to conclude this chapter with some selected verses of our great book of wisdom the Bhagavad Gita, which not only inspired me to improve my level of concentration but also gives me some fruitful methods to improve it. In chapter 06, verse 26 Lord Krishna said, "Yato-yato nischalati manaschanchalmasthiram. Tarasta to niyamyetdatasmanev vasham nayet." Which means, "whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wonders one should bring it back and continually focus it on god or worthy goal." So, we can say that our mind has general tendency to wonder here and there but we can control it by practice over it. In Chapter 6 verse 6 the Lord Krishna quoted, "For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those were fail to do so, the mind works like the enemy.

## tips for enhancing your concentration level

People who will search can easily find many tips to improve attention and concentration. Though it was very difficult to search top five but I am sharing here the five most useful and practically adopted tips for enhancing concentration and attention.

1. Work in distraction free environment in initial level of concentration practice.
1. Take proper balance food according to your age, sex, climate condition and nature of work.
1. Small naps and breaks also refreshes your mind thus helpful in boosting our contraction power.
1. Divide bigger tasks into meaningful smaller tasks.
1. Deep breathing and meditation are also very effective to train one's mind alive and concentrated.

## goals are important

Last but not the least, I have observed in my life that whenever I am having a clear goal in my life my mind itself adopted a higher concentration level. I will explore the importance of a clear goal in our life in a separate chapter. (link to #13 )

## meditation helps

Many people have asked me, which type of meditation or rituals one should practice to boost their concentration level.
It is also explained in the Bhagavadgita chapter 06 verse 12 and 13 as:
"Seated firmly, the yogi should strive to purify the mind by focusing it in meditation with one pointed concentration, controlling all thoughts and activities." -12
"He must hold the body, neck and head firmly in a straight line, and gaze at tip of the nose without allowing the eyes to wander." -13

There are many types of other practices one can do to enhance their concentration level but as I found by my own experience 15 minutes practice of observing the breathing pattern consciously with closed eyes in any comfortable position is very useful in enhancing our concentration power. Moreover, if you practice consciously of doing any of your task of 2 to 5 minutes with full attention it will train your mind for doing other works with full attention.
