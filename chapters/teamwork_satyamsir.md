# teamwork

When 'I' is replaced with 'we' even illness turns into Wellness. This is the power of a team.
I elaborate the team as 'T' means together, 'E' means everyone, 'A' means achievement and "M' means more. So we can say that Team stands for "together everyone achievement more."

## past experience

As a National Level Player of a team game I have observed it very closely and clearly that when players of of our team supported each other well and played with better combination got better result. I applied it successfully when I was given a duty to lead a national level tournament as a technical delegate and many times as a coach of different level team games.

## practical tips for team

Now we should discuss the best practical tip to become more productive by deputing the task among teammates in such a way that it works as a win-win theory for all them . Even if the person who is not leading a team and preparing for some other project or doing something separately can follow these steps.

## prioritise your work

First prioritise your works in hand in three basic categories:

1. In number 01, you have to put all your most important tasks which can't be accomplished by others. Means you are the best for these tasks among your teammates.
1. In number 02, the most important tasks for the team which should be transferred to your teammates. Means some of your teammates can do it better than you.
1. In number 03, you have to put the works which should be done but not must be done. Means the tasks which are less important for the teams and could be procrastinated for sometime.
   Further you can give ranking in these categories separately like 01A, 01B, and 01C or 02A, 02B and 02C etc. according to your need and priorities.

## second level

Now you have to depute the second level task to the most suitable teammate.
The aim and objectives of the task given to the teammates should be clear. Their roles and responsibilities in achieving the common goal of the team should be well describe to them, which gives every teammates the zeal and enthusiasm to play their positive role in teaching towards the common goal of your team.
All the best to everyone to select the best team for achieving a worthy goal of their life.
