for God's sake! put down your phone..

We all know that phone eats our time like nothing else in this world even then we keep using it. Why? Answer is because we have got addicted to it.
Our brain’s internal wirings have changed which craves for something novel every five minutes. This has affected our ability to concentrate, learn something effectively or do meaningful work.
Tell me if you can relate to one of these behaviours:
You can do any work only under duress. Meaning you work only when there’s a deadline is approaching or you have to update status to some authority.
The moment you try to learn a new skill or concentrate on something and it gets boring your hand automatically (without even you realising it) goes for your phone.
You get in a lift/bus/public place/queue. You know you’re going to wait for like 2-5 minutes (max) and your hand reaches your pocket to get your phone.

I know this happens. This happened with me all the time until I started looking at it through my mind’s eyes. I now see folks glued to their screen everywhere. Even in social gatherings people can’t help but check their phones every so often.

## digital detox won't help

So what do I do? I realised this last year while reading research on productivity. Like everyone out there I thought of doing a digital detox. The one where you announce your departure on social media and delete all the apps from your phone. Did that work? No! Then?

## physical separation helps

I started doing **this simple trick** when I have to work with complete focus like in office or when I am doing a course or writing something. Basically anything which demands my utmost attention, I do this. I switch off the internet on my phone and keep it away. In office, I keep it in my bag. At home, I keep it on the bookshelf physically away from me. Try this and you’ll be amazed how good the saying, “Out of sight, out of mind” is.

## What about calls?

One good thing about 24x7 connectivity is that people don’t call unless it’s a real emergency. Use this to your advantage. You know that you won’t miss out on anything which is needed. For work related pings, communication is key, by which I mean, I have told my managers and colleagues this same thing that my internet will be off when I am at home so if you absolutely need to reach me then call. They understand that everything else will be replied next day tomorrow during work hours. It also helps to maintain a healthy work life balance and is the key to my productivity at home. Bottom line is: Lose your phone to do your best work.
