# consuming the community

## brain wants relief from productivity

No matter how many books you read on productivity, you can't be in production mode all the time. Also, you can't be serious and learning all the time. Brain needs to relax. Like a normal human brain it might want to indulge in some drama, conflict, gossip, and sadly bit\*\*\*ng. Inadvertently, you would like to scroll endlessly through social media feeds. And let me tell you, it's perfectly okay to take a break.

## you can be productive even then

Hey! I am going to tell you that you can be productive even when you're scrolling your social media feed. And I have done it. Initially I was hooked to buzzfeed type articles about movie stars and celebrity. Then I moved to Quora, and whenever I had some time I checked Quora, then moved to Twitter. On Twitter I only follow tech (especially JavaScript related) folks. From there I started looking at Hacker News and Reddit.

## you learn even when consuming drama

People on these forums are mean and argumentative a lot many times. If you go through comments you will get enough drama. But you'll also get perspective, experience and knowledge. To understand what they're saying you have to Google words/terminologies. Even to understand the puns and jokes. And slowly you'll learn their language. In my case, I learnt about startups and JS like this. So, this will teach you the "lingo"!

## using social media to your advantage

You're the average sum of 5 people you hang out with. This is a widely popular rule. So, choose wisely the people you follow online. If you consume content on consumption like: clothing, food, travel etc. You will always feel inadequate and would want more. However, if you consume content on creation: design, presentation, programming etc. you will be inspired to create more. And creation brings the ultimate satisfaction and joy.

## train your social media feed

Articifial Intelligence of Facebook, Twitter, and especially Youtube is your friend. Stop liking memes, stop following those pages and you will see in a month those suggestions are gone. My YT only shows TedTalks, my FB only shows content from the programming groups I am in and Twitter recommends only web dev content. Just give this feedback to your feed, like useful content, and hide useless ones. Slowly, these distractions will go away.

## use the community chat room

You have graduated now, you know the lingo, you have consumed creational content, you have created stuff. Next step is to talk these folks, and virtually hangout with them. Whatever you want to learn more, whatever you want to create more, find chatrooms for it, telegram group, discord server, slack, subreddits, anything and everything. And get your foot in the door.

Form your opinions, have strong ones, but hold those weakly. Be open to learn. Then you will form real connections inside the community. Don't be afraid to express yourself in group. Reach out to people for 1:1 discussion. This is where you form partnerships and teams (#16 ).

## the eureka moment for this chapter

I was making Maggie. But it was not Maggie, it was Patanjali Noodles. And then it hit me. Earlier Baba Ramdev used to curse maggie left, right and center. But then he understood that people are not going to give it up, so he came up with a better alternative. This made me look back on my life and I wrote this chapter while making it, coz you know no maggie can be done in 2 minutes. So, utilised that time.

## conclusion

Just by slowly elevating your brain to consume the right kind of drama, by making it used to a break (which is not break), you can change your outlook and life. Everything in this book comes from personal experience but this particular chapter has helped me a ton in learning quickly. I have changed fields from network security to AI to web dev. And every time I needed to start over, I did exactly this. My playbook is now out in the open! :)
