## understanding the why

It goes without saying that smartphones are the killer of our productivity. They may cause headaches, decreased attention, shortness of temper, sleep disorders and depression. The new researches on this field revealed that when we observe we are being noticed and appreciated by others the specific part of our brain called nucleus accumbens is activated which gives us the sense of satisfaction and pleasure just like eating delicious food, making love and earning money. When we feel this happiness, a time comes when our brain demands it over and over. That's why we are always so curious to go through our social media notification and it's become difficult to keep ourselves away from our smartphones.

## the addiction

It has been found out that basic process of quitting the habit of using smartphones more than our real necessity is similar of quitting other addiction like habit of smoking and alcohol consumption.Thus, we can say that it is the main obstacle of leading a fruitful and productive life. So far my opinion is concerned every difficult and dreadful problem has a simple and useful solution and we are here to focus mainly on solution. If one want a detailed and deep knowledge about all the aspects of forming and quitting habits he/she should read the bestseller book- 'The Power Of Habit' written by Charles Duhigg. Through his research he elaborated that any habit forms through three things (1). Cue or trigger (2). Work/activity and (3) Reward .

## let's break it down

- Activity (You checked your notification)ðŸ”›
- Cue/Trigger(You listen the notifications signal/you put your phone on your hands.)
- ðŸ”›Reward(You watched/read something pleasing to you.)

## the replacement protocol

Now, we should know that we can't diminish any habit, but we can replace it by other or can form a new habit.

So, if we could change the cue/trigger then we can easily change the Habit but still our brain will demand the same reward. So, we should take care of similar reward too.
Now, I am giving some practical examples to change bad habits related to your smartphone :-

1. Turn off notifications
1. Remove distraction based apps from home screen.
1. Use flight mode while doing important work.
1. Change your phone settings.
1. Put your phone away while taking rest.
1. First try to keep yourself away from your smartphone consciously for predetermined few hours, then it should be gradually increased to some days or weeks according to needs. Now, I am giving some practical examples to change habits.

The above mentioned activities will only work on trigger like notification, now do something fruitful and interesting like form the shabbir of playing and doing exercise or learning new skills related to your field when you are away from your smartphone. So the new habit could form.

At last give your mind the similar reward, share your achievement again in social media which you achieved by becoming more productive. So that, your mind will feel better and rewarded and it will easily stick to the new habit .

That's All!
