I would like to start this special chapter with mentioning an incident that occurred in Swami Ramtirtha's life which I have read in a magazine many years before.

## a short story

Once, Swami Ramtirth ji was going to another country to advertise the ideals of Vedas and Upnishadas by a ship. He observed that every morning when he came to the deck of ship after taking bath and completing other morning rituals, an old Japanese man used to be busy there in studying and learning something with a book and a copy. He was so concentrated in his learning that he didn't even notice him nearby. After some days, Swami ji was unable to stop his curiosity, so asked that old man, _"What are you doing mister?"_

The old man just watched him with a smiling face and replied, _"I am learning Chinese language."_ Swamiji then asked him, _"What is your age gentleman?"_
The old man replied, _"I never counted my age so seriously but I am sure that I have crossed ninety."_ As Swami ji knew that Chinese language is a pictorial language and it takes almost 05 years for a normal young person to learn it's scriptures. Swamiji asked him anxiously, _"You are learning Chinese at this age, then when will you use it?"_ The old man counter questioned Swami ji, _" How old are you?"_ Swamiji answered, _"I am about 36."_ Then the old man asked, " Are you Indian ? " Swami ji answered "Yes. " The old person then told him in a firm voice,

> "This is the main cause of the miseries of India. A young person like you believes that there should be some fixed age of learning. He concluded that he keeps learning so that he would feel energized and his mind remain refreshed and active."

Swami ji mentioned this event in his daily diary as a great lesson of his life.
Now, I think there is no need to say about the importance of constant learning. To know the whole concept of learning we should go through the basic concept, laws, types, Plateau and some practical tips to learn fastly.

## meaning of learning

Before getting the idea of lLaws of learning, Types of learning, Plateau and practical tips of fast learning in this chapter you should know about the meaning of learning, which I think could be better understood by the following three definitions:

1.  "Learning consists in doing something new, provided this something new is retained by the individual and reappears in his later activities." _By the studies of Woodworth and Marquis._

1.  “Learning is the relatively permanent change in a person’s knowledge or behavior due to experience. This definition has three components: 1) the duration of the change is long-term rather than short-term; 2) the locus of the change is the content and structure of knowledge in memory or the behavior of the learner; 3) the cause of the change is the learner’s experience in the environment rather than fatigue, motivation, drugs, physical condition or physiologic intervention.”
    _From Learning in Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Richard E. Mayer_

1.  “We define learning as the transformative process of taking in information that when internalized and mixed with what we have experienced changes what we know and builds on what we do. It’s based on input, process, and reflection. It is what changes us.” _From The New Social Learning by Tony Bingham and Marcia Conner_

Now, for better adaptation of the learning process one should know the laws of learning. The laws of learning are credited to Edward Thorndike, an American psychologist who formulated them after observing the learning process shown by lower species but fully applicable for us too. He proposed two types of laws of learning i.e. Primary Laws of Learning and Secondary Laws of Learning.

## three primary laws of learning

1. **Law of Readiness** It simply means, a person will learn something only when he is mentally ready to learn. So, you should prepare yourself physically as well as mentally before going to learn anything new.

1. **Law of Exercise** This law says, "when a modifiable connection is made frequently between a situation and a response, the strength of that connection is increased, but when a modifiable connection is not made between a situation and a response over a length of time, the strength of that connection is decreased."

   Thorndike explained it as _"other things being equal, exercise strengthens the bond between situation and response."_
   This law is usually categorised into (a) Law of Use and (b) Law of Disuse.

   You can also see the influence of this law when you go through the chapter on 'Exercise' of this book.

1. **Law of Effect** This law states that " if the effort in doing any work is enjoyable, positive and pleasant, the individual tries to learn that activity quickly and learns it too."
   This law is also known as the _Law of satisfaction and dissatisfaction_.

## secondary laws of learning

_Thorndike_ has proposed the following nine secondary laws of learning :

1. **Law of Primacy** It simply means the first or primary impressions are clear and easy to learn.

1. **Law of Recency** It means what we learn at last remains fresh in our mind.

1. **Law of Contiguity** It is also called Law of Association. It means if the new knowledge or skill is associated with what we have learnt earlier, helps us to learn the new one.

1. **Law of Multiple Responses** According to this law, when a learner takes a new challenge he will approach it with multiple responses, in quest to know which one is the solution.

1. **Law of Contrast** If a person has learnt a skill properly, he can learn it's opposite skill easily.

1. **Law of Similarity** This law states that it is easy to learn similar skills or activity. Like one who knows how to ride a bicycle easily learns riding scooter.

1. **Law of Intensity of Stimulus** This law states that a strong stimulus creates a strong response thus it promotes the learning process.

1. **Law of Association Shifting** This law states that a conditioned response may be shifted to a new stimulus as a new type of response.
1. **Law of Attitude** This law states that one person gives more attention to what interests him.

## what's transfer of learning

If we use the knowledge of these laws of learning while learning new skills or topic it will be beneficial for us. We can also use the power of 'Transfer of Learning' for effective learning. For this purpose first we should know, "What is transfer of learning?"

1. According to M L Bigge, "Transfer of learning occurs when a person's learning in one situation influences his learning and performance in the other situations."

1. According to Alexander and Murphy,"The process of using knowledge or skills acquired in one context in a new and varied context is called transfer of learning."

## factors affecting transfer of learning

There are many kinds of Transfer of Learning which I have read during the studies of sports psychology but one can use it positively by considering the following factors which influence them

1. The learner should grasp the situation and methods of skill he/she is going to learn and should increase their efficiency to identify similarities and contrasts between the new skill and previous skills.
1. The ability to chunk the skill in small parts.
1. The level of intelligence to take the whole situation and learning process in a sequence in mind.
1. The most important thing is the will power and desire of the learner to learn new things.

## plateau of learning

Now you should also know that sometimes our speed of learning any specific skill, which was rapid in the initial phase, slows down and eventually stops. In educational psychology this situation is termed as 'Plateau'. To get rid of this Plateau one should consider the following things:

1. One should not make the things boring by repeating the same process of learning daily. They should try the new methods indeed.
1. One should also consider their physical and mental limitations.
1. One should search out the new area of interest according to the situations of life.
1. Train the mind to be alive and focused on later periods of life.
1. There should be a moderate challenge for a feeling of healthy competition in one's life.

## practical tips for faster learning

At last, if end is well all is well so here are some practical tips for faster learning.

1. Keep changing or keep modifying your learning methods.
1. Learn by doing instead of watching or observing.
1. Make the things more meaningful before going to learn that.
1. Always be ready to teach what you have learnt.
1. Spend time in practicing the things which you find difficult to perform.
1. Test yourself frequently and take frequent breaks too.
1. Find a mentor and be curious about new things.

All the best to everyone for learning new and valuable things because it is said rightly

> Learning is endless.
