# attention

## a story for good gpa

Let me tell you a story. there is a close friend and let's say his name is Mayank. Mayank was a topper in college. He would get somewhere around 9.5+ GPA. And he was not a meritorious student all his life but suddenly transformed into this person. From 7.5+ GPA in first few semesters to 9.5+ in later ones. How did he do that? We wondered? We thought he might be good at mugging up stuff and dismissed doing that in college. He was talking to my sister before she was going to college and she was asking for tips. I was a passive participant.
He said, and I quote, "I rarely studied after class but I found out that almost all the questions in exams come from what was covered in the class. It could be sometimes on the board and sometimes a passing reference from the teacher just before sessional exams to drop a hint." And then he continued, "I figured that I can't ditch the classes then might as well pay attention to what is being taught". And that's it. He made a choice which made all the difference.

## the choice is yours

When you're listening to a podcast, or attending a conference, or seeing a tutorial, or forced into a meeting. There are always two choices: the first and easy one is to zone off and all students are trained at that. The other one is hard but it comes with practice. And then when you learn to pay attention to hard and sometimes boring things you utilise all this time.

## a simple trick

To say that I have perfected this would be an exaggeration but I do try to mindfully practice this. One trick if you are getting bored or sleepy by a lecture is to start taking notes. You will see that suddenly your posture changes and you become much more active. This trick is handy when you're forced to be in a meeting, a seminar, a class or something like that. However, there are times when you want to manage your productivity outside work hours. We'll discuss this in detail now.

## stop trying to manage time

Productivity comes from the word "produce". It's a medieval term, a remnant of industrial and agricultural ages. However, people reading this book are gearing up to become the best knowledge workers. And knowledge workers shouldn't measure themselves in "hours". Many a times, I get this question, "Tanay! How many hours do you code daily?". The problem with this question is that the one who's asking this thinks that if you just code for X number of hours a day, you can groom yourself to work in some of the biggest companies in the world. The other part of the problem is that if somehow one isn't able to code for this mythical X hours, they're not meant for coding/programming or whatever they're preparing for in the life.

Instead of trying to manage time, put a checklist on every hour of the day, try to manage attention. Attention management is something which differentiates the great from the good. We discuss how focus is currently under constant attack and how to defend it in the distraction chapter. Here, I am going to tell you the amazing things which will happen if you manage your focus.

## the way you measure success needs to change

If you start narrowing your focus, attention will surface. Trying to do too many things in one day, achieving everything, would make your attention wander. It will decrease your quality of work. And not only work, your relationships too suffer when you're not managing your attention properly. Trying to reply emails when it's time to talk to your parents, spouse, or kids is as toxic as it sounds. You read books of a certain billionare running two companies and working 100 hours a week and think you can emulate him. You're only setting yourself up for failure here. The type of work executives do is very different from the type of work we do. Always optimise for quality of life after work, spend quality time with your loved ones. Give them the attention they deserve and one day when you're successful, tabloids won't run stories about your failed marriages. A subtle message here is that please have your own measures of success and then manage attention to everything accordingly.

## managing attention in office

The problem with these open office plans, instant messaging tools like Slack are that they constantly strive for your attention. Trust me this is such a big issue that companies are now fighting backwards to get away from this. They're giving noise cancelling headphones, organising no meeting days and what not. There are two aspects to this, first one is that they have understood that they have overdone collaboration. In trying to be open all the time, employees have lost focus hours and now the work is taking more time than it should, while the quality suffers.

The second problem is that employees are unhappy! You might ask why? When you give attention to something, when you focus your entire energy on creating something, you create a masterpiece. This creation, this intense focus gives you satisfaction. Some studies have suggest that this makes you happy and we derive our lives' meaning out of this craftsmanship. So, when after a two week sprint you don't see something worth being proud of, you feel really bad for yourself and that unhappiness trickles down to everything.

**what's the solution?** While management has learnt its lesson and trying to do all the no meeting hours, core hours, noise cancellation headphones and what not, you can do your own piece too. Remember that change starts with you. I'm sharing what I do. But understand that this is a team effort and it takes time to bring these changes.

1. _Define your focus hours:_ I start working at 8AM. From years I have been doing this. It gives me some core focus hours before everyone wakes up and comes to office. Some of my colleagues get these core hours after 5PM when everyone who started working at 8 has signed off. You can book your own calendar for few hours daily to make sure you take control.

1. _decide on overlapping hours:_ When I was in Cisco, we had good 11AM to 3PM time where everyone was in office. Which meant all meetings were scheduled during this time only. This is a great thing to have even if your team starts at the same time. Dedicating hours for collaboration, makes your mind work get into deep work during the other time, knowing that no one is going to disturb.

1. _learn to document:_ Half of our problems at office is because someone knows something and he/she is the only person. This could be you. The problem is that when someone is blocked on you, they can't wait for the _overlapping hours_ to ping you. They want to get themselves unblocked to move past and you can't blaim them for breaking your flow or pulling you out of your deep work state. The best way to get out of this jam in future is to keep documenting and sharing what you learn. Make it easy for someone to find those as well.

1. _nohello, async communication is the key:_ When you need something from someone in office, don't hey and leave it. It's better to say Hi and give context. This way you make the communication asynchronous. The other person, whenever he/she comes online can answer it. This is the reason email is preferred over chat because on email you tend to provide more context. With email, the key to write better is to anticipate the next person's counter questions and answer those in advance.

Follow this for setting meetings as well. Put up a clear agenda for the meeting so that they know what is expected, send a pre-read so that they come prepared.

1. _get a room, or a sign:_ There are days when you absolutely need to finish a task against a deadline. In those times, attention management becomes super critical. The best way is to go get a secluded room to avoid shoulder taps, inform your team about the same. You can also get a DND sign for your cubicle, but the problem is that for first few days people will disturb you out of curiosity.

## recommended read: Deep Work

There's a book, which talks only about managing attention. It talks about training your brain to get into hyper focus mode. It's a treasure of a book. If you're into serious scientific readings, I would suggest that book.

However, if you're not into it, the gist of it is that your mind starts functioning at a higher level when you get deep into your work. This can't happen if you go in and out of the work every few minutes. You have to allocate chunks of focus time to get the best out of your mind. Believe it or not, we are not built to multitask, we can walk while listening to a podcast coz your attention is on the podcast, but you can't listen to a podcast and work on a research paper at the same time. Accepting the limitations of our mind and then using it the way it's designed to will help you be more productive in less time.

## flow isn't mythical

When one talks of attention and focus, one has to mention "the flow". Believe it or not, I had experienced this so many times but never knew it was called that. Let me paint a picture for you. Have you ever worked on something, where you lost sense of time, there wasn't any tiredness, hunger escaped, and the most important part: the work was so much fun that it felt like it's own reward? I am sure you had experienced that deep concentration fuelled work, well that is called FLOW. Some also call it "being in the zone".

**how does that help?** Well! research and personal experience both tell me that it brings an amazing internal bliss! You feel happy, not exhausted, even after working grueling hours continuosuly. The major reward however, is that this boosts your output. If you achieve the state of flow you put out a lot of quality work in a lot less time. Do you know how in 3 days hackathons you create an entire app, host it and present it? While working on a side project takes month to completion?

**okay! okay! how can I get it?** So, I told you I have been in flow but didn't know how to get there or what to call it. And then I started reading research around it. The research matches to my experience. So, there are few requirements to get into it. Let me explain.

1. _Distraction Free Environment._ This is a must. If everyone or everything is vying for your attention then you can't get into flow. Flow needs sustenance and a clear environment gives it that.

1. _Incremental Wins._ To sustain flow, you need to have small tasks, and you need to keep closing those small tasks. In programming any app, you have smaller components and functions and the more components you code, the feeling of win increases and you sustain the flow. As you can see that breaking your task into smaller chunks is a recurring theme in this book. Master that skill for enhanced productivity.

1. _Tasks should be doable._ If you take up something which you don't know how to do your mind will give up and it will start to wander. Therefore, you can't achieve flow in a task which you're doing for the very first time, or something which is way beyond your capability. To get to flow in such conditions: read ahead, prepare for it, do the research before hand i.e. **increase your skill**

1. _Tasks should not be boring._ I guess flow is so hard to achieve because it needs the right balance of challenge as well. If you're doing something daily and it has become like a chore you won't get into flow state doing that. What to do? Increase the difficulty of your task. Add a twist, a new challenge.

I know, it's hard to get it right but with deliberate planning you can get these major boosts of productiviy every now and then. Knowing how it works has definitely helped me. If I have to code the same piece of thing again, I choose a different tool/library/framework just so that it's not too boring but at the same time use the same language to make it not too hard. And this helps me in creating my side projects overnight. I hope this example helps you too.

## but, how to manage attention

If I tell you to do meditation, or to practice mindfulness you might run away. There's no easy way to be the master of your attention. I would urge you to start small. One thing which I have learnt through meditation is that it's okay for your mind to wander. Even when you're working on something, your mind might wander, just know that it's wandering.

A bit of mind wandering is good too, when you are working on something creative, writing a blog, a book, preparing a speech, your mind needs to form thoughts, connect dots and for that it will wander. All you have to do is be mindful about it. Let it go anywhere it wants but know that you're the boss, the one in charge.

Now, for many folks, this meditation and mindfulness won't connect. For you, I have saved the best thing for last. Read a book. When was the last time you read a full sized book end to end? With the addiction to social media our mind cannot stay ON for more than 280 characters it seems. It needs hook, it needs novely every few seconds. We don't read essays, research papers anymore. All our knowledge is from tweets or "blogs". Your mind gets bored as soon as you have to read about something for more than few pages. So, you start from here. Start reading a book, start reading research.

One last thing, if it was easy for people to manage their attention, their will, and everything else I am saying in this book, everyone would be the most awesome version of themselves. But we are not, I have failed at following my own advice more than I keep count on. The one thing I know which I always do right is, I never give up. It's a journey, towards being better version of ourselves everyday. Learn to love the journey.
