## what is it?

'Procrastination' is the habit of delaying any work till the last moment. Have you ever procrastinated the things in your life ? Did it harm you in some way ? I know if you are honest the answer will be 'yes'. No one is exception here. We all procrastinated the important task of life more or less. But who procrastinated the less got the more. You can say' 'less procrastination brings more success'.
Now, if you want to leave this habit, I would like to discuss here top four causes and their remedies one by one which I have searched through world's best seller books on this topic with adding my own experiences about it.

## punishment and reward

The first major cause of procrastination is "Not a clear punishment and reward in present time". When you feel that there is no punishment and reward in present time for the things we easily procrastinate that. For example, we easily procrastinate our exercise schedule because we don't find reward and punishment for it in present Or easily procrastinate our study schedule if there is no exam dates nearby.

To leave such kind of procrastination I will suggest to set an immediate punishment and reward from your own side to start the small things for new things which you think is going to benefit you in your life in long term. For example, you can restrict your mind that I will take my favourite food or will watch my favourite movie when I will finish the task in hand or when I will start doing this project etc.
You can also adopt the **'two minutes method'.** Means you can train your mind that if any assignment or work comes to me I will do that immediately at least only for 2 minutes. Because it will break the inertia of our mind and most of the times it is observed that if we start doing anything for two minutes our mind easily continue that further.

## fear of failure

The second major cause of procrastination is 'Fear of failure'. Our mind loves to do such work that is either easy aur which gives it a feeling of joy and success. We can also relate it with our ego system. This kind of people are always afraid of others opinion. In Hindi it is said, _'Inka sabse bada rog kya kahenge log'._
The best remedy of it is to give your mind a clear logic of doing any new work. For example, the two lines of Javed Akhtar which helps me in putting new and valuable habits in my life is 'Kyon daren jindagi me kya hoga kuchh na hoga to tajurba hoga'. Means, why to worry in doing new things. It is going to give experience even after failing in it and that will be a valuable asset for our life. It is also said that, _'Manjil mil hi jayegi der se hi sahi, gumrah to wo hein jo ghar se nikale hi nahin'._ So let's start the journey of success together.

## low energy

The third major cause of procrastination is "low energy level". It is basically of two types physical and mental. Both are interrelated as they influence each other. If we are in low energy level we will not be able to even follow our daily routine life. The remedy is very simple but most of the people don't adopt it. If anyone wants to boost his energy level only balance diet, balance rest and balance dose of exercise is recommended. We will deal with balance dose of exercise in our day to day life in next chapter.

For balanced diet we should eat a variety of food especially filled with fresh fruits and green vegetables. It is also revealed by the nutritionists that we should concentrate on the of the food which we are eating and grind it properly in the mouth. It gives our body a positive symptom of taking food and thus our brain give signal to secret all kind of good enzymes to digest the taken food properly.

For balance rest and sleep I recommend people 'Counting the deep breath with body relaxation method'. Many people including me have adopted this method successfully to sleep deeply and wake up with greater energy level. In this method when you go to your bed in night then after completion of sleeping rituals like evaluating your present day and planning your next day l mentally. Start taking slow and deep breath with counting it mentally. After inhaling and exhaling deeply once we have to count one and likewise we should go forward. In this process our body should be fully relaxed and we should watch the deep breathing process. If your body really need a sleep you will not be able to count a continuous hundred breath. If anyhow you will be successful, It will give your body proper rest and fill it with more oxygen for proper functioning of other system. So, we should practice it regularly.

## inertia

The fourth and the last major cause of procrastination is "Our brain wants to live in its comfort zone". It is also observed that our brain acts according to 'Law of Inertia'. It tends to live at its initial position and hinders to start any new task. If anyone wants to act against this Law of Inertia of our mind they should work on their will power. Because it is the most powerful tool to break this comfort zone and all the other cause of procrastination. Will power is alone sufficient to eradicate all the problems related to our mind.

Now, we should discuss the method to develop the willpower. I am sharing here what I have successfully examined and practiced in my own life. If you want to increase your willpower you should start with small things. Even small things like sitting in a place with closed eyes for 5 minutes can increase your willpower a little bit and can create a base to increase it further. Just you have to practice to do such things consciously. Even if you are walking around your home or drinking water just decide it in advance in simple and funny way like, this time I will take only 50 steps and I will return to my study table or I will finish this glass of water in 5 sips.

Initially you may think, _'will it really work'?_ But believe me, when your brain will train in doing what you are deciding in advance. It will start working according to your will without procrastination.

At last, I want to summarise this chapter in two small instructions, 'start small' and 'continue your efforts even after failures'. So don't wait, if you really want to leave this habit just for practice close the book right now and start doing any other important task in your hand at least for few minutes without any further procrastination.
