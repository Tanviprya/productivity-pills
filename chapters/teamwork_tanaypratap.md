# teamwork

## conflict of upbringing

The main problem with us: nerds and geeks of India (don't know about other countries, can't comment), is that we are not programmed to work in a team since our childhood. We have been pressurised to compete against the kid next door, against our classmates, our cousins and everyone around us. Do you remember any subject where you would get marks for **teamwork**? As a society we are raising our kids wrong.

## most stated problem

While coming up with this book, we did surveys on what stops you from working on your side project, or coding daily, or anything which you want to do after office? And almost everyone replied that they lose the motivation as no one asks about it anymore. We complete our homework, our office work as we have exams or stand ups. Basically, we do work when we are answerable to someone.
This is where I answered everyone to get a teammate. A learning buddy, a project partner. It will help you when you don't feel like working, and you will help when he/she doesn't feel like it. My favorite: **the pull push dynamics of learning**.

## ok, how to get a teammate?

If you're looking for "where to find a teammate?", I would suggest read #15 first.
Remember, how we were raised to be competitive. This needs to change. We need to cultivate a habit of looking forward to help. When you meet someone, listen with an intent to construct on his thought, don't argue to prove your intelligence (a lot many people do that, internet is filled with them), rather listen to help. Find out what they're looking for, challenges they are facing, their interests. Remember, **first step is communication**.

## learn to pitch a project

Do your homework. People like people who are well prepared on a project. Have a one page doc, a PPT. "I have a million dollar idea, I'm looking for a technical cofounder" sounds as vague and uninviting as possible. Don't be that person.
Come up with exact tasks, goals for the other person. Have a clear win defined for them. Now, remember how in previous step you were listening to people with an intent to help? reach out to those people whose interests align with your goals. Always, and I repeat, always strive to create a **win win situation**.

## some personal experience

When folks ask me, "Tanay! how can you do so many things? Podcasts, Youtube, Book, Newsletter etc.?". My first response (in a very Tony Stark from Avengers 1 style) is, "I have a team". We are 3 on podcasts, 2 on newsletter, an entire group on Youtube/Instagram (we call ourselves Meta Universe). I don't think I have any project which I am doing all alone, all by myself.

## who is the perfect teammate?

Someone with expertise in a different field. Let's take this book as an example, productivity is not my forte, I have got accidental success here, so I roped in an expert, who has done extensive study on it i.e. Satyam Sir. Moosa has tons of experience in marketing, so we teamed up for the React Newsletter, he took care of the entire setup, and I took care of the content curation. There are few things which I look for in a teammate, might be helpful for you as well:

1. Expertise
1. Motivated and Committed. He/She should have some past success and delivery history.
1. Intelligence and Awareness so that he/she can bring new ideas to the table.
1. Most importantly, personal connection and fun quotient. Coz I'm going to spend a lot of time with this person, might as well have fun while at it.

I have been almost always successful in finding the right teammate for any project. At the same time, I try to imbibe these 4 qualities in myself as well, so that people include me when they come up with an idea and looking for a teammate.
