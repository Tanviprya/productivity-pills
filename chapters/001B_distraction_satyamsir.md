## story time

Once, one of the courtiers of a famous king asked a question, "Maharaj, how do you maintain such a good harmony in personal, family and social life? Why you don't get distracted from other things when you do one thing?"

Maharaj said, "I will answer this question later. First you will have to give a test. The king ordered a bowl full of oil and said, "Within half an hour you have to take a round of the entire garden of the palace. On the way, you are completely free to see the beautiful flowers of the garden and feel its aroma. Just remember, my two soldiers will follow you all the way along with their sword and if one drop of oil falls from your bowl, they will separate your head from the torso."

As per the orders of the Maharaja, the courtier departed from there with his oil-filled bowl and he returned efficiently just before half an hour. He was very happy because not a single drop of oil had spilled. The Maharaja asked him "Let's now tell how the new flowers planted in the palace garden. Tell the people in this court about their fragrance." Hearing this question, the courtier said, "Maharaj, my 100% focus was on the oil of bawl so I could neither see the flowers nor feel the fragrance of them. I could not even wait to see anything, because I had to come back in time. So pardon me. "

Maharaj smiled and said, "I did not send any soldiers after you. I wanted to tell you that when you were completely focused on the oil bowl bounded with time, you could see nothing but that." That time no other things has distracted you. Similarly, I have practiced that when I work on one aspect of my life, then I keep my entire focus on that task at that time. For me at that time very that time is the most important time of my life. And that work is the most important work. I practice to live life in the very present. It is the main secret of my health and happiness.

I don't know about the authenticity of this story but I totally agree with the lesson which has given through the story. So, if we really want to live a healthy, happy and successful life we should practice not to get distracted from our important work. I have explained about it also in the other chapter of this book named 'Attention Management'. In this chapter I am going to discuss about the major source of distraction of our today's life - 'The smart phones'

## understanding the why

It goes without saying that smartphones are the killer of our productivity. They may cause headaches, decreased attention, shortness of temper, sleep disorders and depression. The new researches on this field revealed that when we observe we are being noticed and appreciated by others the specific part of our brain called nucleus accumbens is activated which gives us the sense of satisfaction and pleasure just like eating delicious food, making love and earning money. When we feel this happiness, a time comes when our brain demands it over and over. That's why we are always so curious to go through our social media notification and it's become difficult to keep ourselves away from our smartphones.

## the addiction

It has been found out that basic process of quitting the habit of using smartphones more than our real necessity is similar of quitting other addiction like habit of smoking and alcohol consumption.Thus, we can say that it is the main obstacle of leading a fruitful and productive life. So far my opinion is concerned every difficult and dreadful problem has a simple and useful solution and we are here to focus mainly on solution. If one want a detailed and deep knowledge about all the aspects of forming and quitting habits he/she should read the bestseller book- 'The Power Of Habit' written by Charles Duhigg. Through his research he elaborated that any habit forms through three things (1). Cue or trigger (2). Work/activity and (3) Reward .

## let's break it down

- Activity (You checked your notification)ðŸ”›
- Cue/Trigger(You listen the notifications signal/you put your phone on your hands.)
- ðŸ”›Reward(You watched/read something pleasing to you.)

## the replacement protocol

Now, we should know that we can't diminish any habit, but we can replace it by other or can form a new habit.

So, if we could change the cue/trigger then we can easily change the Habit but still our brain will demand the same reward. So, we should take care of similar reward too. Now, I am giving some practical examples to change bad habits related to your smartphone :-

## Turn off notifications

- Remove distraction based apps from home screen.
- Use flight mode while doing important work.
- Change your phone settings.
- Put your phone away while taking rest.
- First try to keep yourself away from your smartphone consciously for predetermined few hours, then it should be gradually increased to some days or weeks according to needs. Now, I am giving some practical examples to change habits.

The above mentioned activities will only work on trigger like notification, now do something fruitful and interesting like form the shabbir of playing and doing exercise or learning new skills related to your field when you are away from your smartphone. So the new habit could form.

At last give your mind the similar reward, share your achievement again in social media which you achieved by becoming more productive. So that, your mind will feel better and rewarded and it will easily stick to the new habit .
