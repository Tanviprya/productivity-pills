# subconscious programming (satyamsir)

In our opinion 'to use our subconscious mind efficiently' is the most useful productive pill we can use for making ourselves more productive. So we decided to reveal it in our last chapter.

As most of the common people state that, 'we loose one third of our productive hours in sleeping,' we should know that sleeping not only refreshes our mind and body, it also works as a tool to create a base for our will power to accomplish the work in our hand and thus help us to achieve our goal.

The research in this field reveals that our subconscious mind is more powerful than our conscious mind and it works for us 24Ã—7. When sometime in our life, we just only plan to wake up early due to some important event and forget to set an alarm, most of the time we wake up just on time. It is just due to the power of our subconscious mind. Means we all have observed it's power without knowing the greater use of it. If someone really want to know the power of it and the practical uses of it's power in different aspects of our life one should read the world's best seller book on this topic with title _'The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind' written by Dr. Joseph Murphy_.

I am quoting here three most useful and practical tips to make ourselves more productive:--

1. Plan your next day before you go to bed
   It is observed that as soon as you go to bed and start planning your next day's schedule and important tasks at your hand. It helps a lot to carry out the next day schedule successfully thus you use the time between period of going to bed and falling asleep really.

1. Review your goal every single night
   Just few seconds or minutes before going to deep sleep review your tasks of your previous day and evaluate yourself how much you succeed to go towards your goal. It also helps in rectifying the schedule for next day. It is also found that if you speak aloud your main goal of life or important goal at your hand at least three times, it gives a task to our subconscious mind to create new ideas to achieve it. In this way we use our sleeping time for achieving our goal and become more productive than others.

1. Train your subconscious mind to give answers of important questions of our lives
   Many successful persons of different fields have revealed the secret during their interview or in their writings that if they couldn't find any answer to a particular question they just used to think upon it before going to fall asleep and when they woke up they got their answer. Even some of them got up midnight with their answer. Sometimes it may take days, weeks or even months but it works surely.

The psychologists researching in this field conclude that the time when we are going to sleep is the right time to give tasks to our subconscious mind as it is rest time for our conscious mind and subconscious mind is going to lead in our sleep time with it's mysterious power of imagination and dreaming.

By the way, I had also read about some successful persons that they use to go for their sleep with some useful audio listening. So that the time before entering into the deep sleep may be utilised and our subconscious mind keeps working on it.
Means we can conclude that if we want to be more productive, we should use even our sleeping time for achieving our goals.

It is rightly said, " Nothing is easy if you are lazy and everything is easy if you are crazy. "

Remember it, 'reaching to a destination is the starting point of other.'

So let's become crazy to be more productive and achieve worthy goals of our life. All the best to all of us. :)
