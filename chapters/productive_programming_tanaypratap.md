# programming your subconscious

## background

When we decided to write this book, we thought of writing everything we knew about productivity. However, soon we realised that it's an impossible task to complete. So one day, we got on a call and discussed the top 10 topics. We both got 5 votes. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, Satyam Sir used his veto on putting this chapter in. This was something I was not onboard to be honest, but he insisted, he said that this is the ultimate weapon his arsenal and that we should end the book with this. Fine! I said, I trust him much more to argue over one chapter.

So, I asked him to write this chapter first. I would read it, try to follow it and then at least can write my experiences around it. When I read the chapter, I started practising it. He talks about sleeping with the productive/positive thoughts. And trust me, this whole Covid situation has been hard on all of us. But this one trick, has helped me a lot to stay on track every day. I did lose few days but like a compass this chapter (satyam sir's version) showed me the right path. I think I will be eternally thankful to him for introducing this thought process to me. I then ordered the book, "The Power of Subconscious Mind" and read it cover to cover. If you read that book, you'll find that the ideas are getting repeated over and over again. And sometimes it would be hard to believe the miracles too. It asks for a lot of faith, which is hard to come by in today's world. However, when I started looking into my own life, I found that the things I have done right are because of the right seeds, and the things which have gone wrong were also my doing. Thus, for better or worse, I am in control of my life.

To make this chapter pragmatic, I decided to name this "programming your subconscious mind". In this last chapter, I will draw from my experiences and try to give some macros (these are short programs in computer science world) to run. Stories or experiences are just to set the mood, look for the macros, look for the pattern and I think you'll find this whole chapter life chaning in literal sense. So, let's get started.

## oh! I know how to solve that issue

There are memes around this. That how a programmer brains suddenly, at 2 or 3AM at night wakes up and tells you the solution. To fix that bug you have been struggling with for maybe hours or days. This has happened to me multiple times, I am sure this has happened to you too, and if not, wait for it. How does that happen though? When you're thinking about a problem in hand, sometimes the focused mode doesn't get you the answer. Then what? the diffused mode gets it to you. If you're struggling with a problem, before sleeping try to think about it in a positive way, _asking the right question to your brain is important_ though. Instead of, "Why am I so stupid?", try, "I know I can solve it, I will let the idea come to me".

> Get started with the right questions, and the answers will pop, use the diffuse mode!

## you have a supercomputer

Yes I am talking about your mind, but not the conscious mind. There have been multiple research around it which says how your subconscious can process much larger amounts of data compared to your conscious. If your conscious mind is a good gaming PC, your subconscious is like those big Google servers which can churn out anything you throw at it. Question is, how do I use this supercomputer?

You can't actively use this part of your brain. But think about it, all your bodily functions: heartbeat, seeing, hearing, all your passive decision making: running away from dark, trusting someone's vibe. All of it is being processed 24x7 until the day you die, and it's all done by this part of the brain. And still has a lot of power to spare. To use this power you have to relax, you have to play, you have to move away from work. You need to rest and rejuvenate. You need to distract. You need to do after planting the right seeds, or asking the right questions. And you will get an answer.

> Sleeping, playing, relaxation, and rejuvenation is not for the week, it's for the superiors who believe in the hustle of mind over body

## let's talk about bias

Today's world has painted bias in a negative light, and rightly so. However, we need to ask ourselves, why do we have bias? Answer is: It's an evolutionary advantage. Bias is nothing but a shortcut on your neural pathways, i.e. mental shortcuts. It's just that in the modern world we have all wrong sorts of bias and hence the bad rep.

If you use the techniques described in this chapter: asking the right questions, visualization, identity assumption you can actually make the right kinds of bias in your mind. This would help in faster decision making. Your mind's confusion clouds around which path to take will start clearing up.

## visualization

One thing which always help when you're nervous about something is to visualize yourself doing it. I read this when I was a kid, I don't know which book it was: You Can Win by Shiv Kheda or Memory, Mind and Body by Biswaroop Roy Choudhary.
When I was afraid of giving speech, I would imagine myself delivering the perfect speech, and people clapping. This might sound absurd if you haven't tried it yet, but it does help. Though in this example it's about a public speaking one off incident, this same visaulization can be used for long term goals as well.

When I came back to programming full time, leaving Network Security field in 2015, I started with in Cisco. I used to read the style guides published by Google and Microsoft. And used those guides in my own code. No one used to do code review in Cisco but I did my own. Why? I had this vivid image that I will be working with the best programmers and I need to keep my programming standards high. Little did I know that things would turn around in next 1-2 years I will end up working in Microsoft. Mind you, I never applied for Microsoft, didn't even visit their career site once. Now, all of this sounds spooky when I talk about it but come to think of it, visualization was working its magic quietly in the background.

> You would have heard multiple times, "Confidence is the key to success!". But you don't know how to get that confidence.

This is a pretty powerful technique. You're nervous because you think you're not equipped or talented enough to accomplish something. The self doubt in you hinders your own growth. You would have heard multiple times, "Confidence is the key to success!". But you don't know how to get that confidence. This is the shortest path to gaining confidence. Visualize yourself being good at programming, or giving talks, or writing a book, or doing 50 pushups daily, or losing those extra few kilos. If you can visualize vividly with the details, your mind starts forming those connections to make you confident in achieving it. Your subconscious (the super computer) will churn out the path from where you are to where you want to be.

When you hear successful or famous folks talking about luck, saying that they were at the right place at the right time, about not giving up and knowing in the depth of their heart that they'll be successful. They are talking about the power of visualization.

> Takeway: When you think about your future have positive and strong mental pictures. Only thing between you and your success is your belief in yourself.

## assuming an identity

Continuing from the previous part, your attitude determines success or failure. We talked about getting past a major event, or working towards success in life. There's another place where it can help you: creating productive habits.

> “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t – you’re right” - Henry Ford

Feed the right identity. At this point my word counter is going crazy with the use of word "right", in this chapter, but it's important to understand that your subconscious is susceptible to suggestion but it doesn't know what's good or bad for you. So, it's the work of your conscious mind to create positive thoughts, visualizations, identity and then give it to your subconscious mind. Like any super computer, your subconscious works on the principle of Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Take care that you're using the GIGO principle for good: Good In Good Out. Oh! I love wordplays!

Anyway, coming back to the topic of identity creation. "I don't watch TV series". Sometime in college, I decided that I don't want to invest my time in passive consumption. TV series are the worst. You have all the episodes at once, the writing is addictive, and it just eats up your days or weeks. Not a good thing for someone who wants more from life. So, I told myself, "I don't watch TV series." I decided that I will only start a new series when an old series which is running has ended. So at any point of time, I'll be watching like 1-2 or over the year. And since these are running series, there's no possibility of binge watch! Clever! So, this saved a lot of time. If you don't binge watch series or movies over the weekends or semester breaks you get a lot of time to read, become interesting, or create things of value.

Continuing on this identity example, when people suggest, "OMG! You should totally watch GoT or that XYZ series which have come on that popular streaming platform". My answer always is, " I don't watch TV series". This has gone so deep in me that now I am not even tempted to watch anything which is a rage in general populace. I don't find the series interesting anymore. I tried binge watching something few days back, after 4-5 episodes, I couldn't do it. This is the power of assuming an identity.

When you assume an identity: "I don't smoke", "I care about my fitness", "I am productive person" etc. you subconsciously gravitate towards people who are like you. Who have similar identities. And these folks would also like befriending you. Success begets success and similarly successful folks begets successful folks. You know how you meet someone for the first time and your vibe matches? That's your subconscious doing match making. It's reading cues from the other person's identity and matching it with yours. All my friends from past few years are really amazing people. And at the same time I have lost a lot of friends who were assuming identities which didn't match with me.

> Simple things have amazing powers. And the confidence these habits build in you is enormous.

This entire thing feeds right into habit formation. If you want to lose weight, instead of saying, "I am trying to lose weight" or "I am trying to cut carbs". Say, "I care about my fitness", "I don't eat carbs". These are small things but goes a long way. When a lot of adults I know can't function without tea or swear by their coffee to get their day started. Just by saying, "I don't drink tea", I have kept caffeine away from me for all those years. I have got a super productive personality which doesn't run on coffee beans! Simple things have amazing powers. And the confidence these habits build in you is enormous. If you know you can stop coffee, smoking, drinking, fried food, sugar i.e. some of the most addictive stuff in human history, you know you can do anything in life.

> Create the right and strong identity for yourself, and see how your subconscious creates habits around it.

## know what you want

It's time to say goodbye. I think the major part of this chapter has talked about how you can achieve anything you want by programming yourself the right way. The major part of this book talks about ideas and tips which could give your program some performance boost. There's a major question left to answer though.

What's the program which you want to run? In simpler terms, what is that you want to achieve in life? With all this power you should make intelligent choices. There's always a fine line between a superhero and supervillain. Both have super powers. Both have tragedies. The choice they make post that tragedy decides their trajectory.

> "Success" means different for different people. Know what it means to you.

So, here's my suggestion. Give yourself sometime to think about the goal before you start working towards it. Meditation, Yoga Nidra etc. will help you find what really makes you happy and contented. There are books like "Think and Grow Rich", "Secret", "5AM Club" and I don't know how many more which talks about the power of knowing attracting what you want in life: moeney, fame, relationships, anything. The key point which people miss is that they don't know what exactly they want from their lives. This all could be too philosophical for you, but it's important to understand. "Success" means different for different people. Know what it means to you. Not because someone else has something, but because if you have it you will be at peace and bliss.

## the power of sankalpa

Once you know what you want you use the sankalpa in Yoga Nidra practice to plant it deep in your subconscious. I love what Swami Satyananda Saraswati says during the practice, I am blessed to have his presence in my life, and will end this book with his words around Sankalpa:

"Your Sankalpa, the resolution should be _simple, short, in clear language_, with frank expression, with faith. Resolves made before and after yoga nidra are sure to become a truth and reality in your life. Anything in life can fail but not the resolve made before and after yoga nidra. The same resolve, in the same language, with the same understanding, and with the same background, must be repeated day after day.

> Anything in life can fail but not the resolve made before and after yoga nidra.

In the beginning and at the end of yoga nidra; kindly remember to repeat the same resolution at the end of the process also, before you open the eye and come out of yoga nidra.
The resolve, the Sankalpa, is repeated three times at the beginning and three times in the end. Go on repeating, go on, go on repeating."

\- By Paramhans Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Rikhia Yoga Peeth.
