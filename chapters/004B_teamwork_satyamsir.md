When 'I' is replaced with 'we' even illness turns into Wellness. This is the power of a team. I elaborate the team as

'T' means together,

'E' means everyone,

'A' means achievement and

'M' means more.

So we can say that Team stands for **"together everyone achievement more."**

As a player I have represented State team and University team many times as a Volleyball player which is a team game. As a team game player I have observed it very closely and clearly that when players of of our team supported each other well and played with better combination got better result. I applied it successfully when I was given a duty to lead a national level tournament as a technical delegate and many times as a coach of different level team games.

## incident one

For dealing with this topic I am going to mention here three incidents of my professional sports life. The year was probably 1994. I was playing at Darbhanga as a member of the Bokaro District Volleyball Team. Our team had lost 02 sets to the Muzaffarpur district team continuously. The spectators and almost all of us had agreed that our defeat in three consecutive seats is certain. But before the third set, our coach Prem Bhaiya called us and said that when the team is losing, then we should try to change some of the players and our strategy. He changed three players and also completely changed the strategy of our game. The result was that the next team which had won the two sets under a particular strategy could not understand our new strategy and lost the third set. After winning the third set, both our enthusiasm and confidence increased and we defeated the Muzaffarpur team by three consecutive sets and won three seats as compared to two.

## incident two

The second incident in my sports life that I would like to mention here is the event of a tournament in the year 2001 at a place called Jamtara. We had a good team in this tournament and we had 06 more teams of our own level. But one team who came from Benaras was much better than all the teams. The league match was held by dividing 04 -04 teams in two groups. The Banaras team was in our own group and like other teams, they defeated us badly in the league match. Then in a tough match, we defeated Bengal team in the semi-finals and entered the final, but in the final we had to play again with the team of Banaras. Spectators, the organizer and the team of Banaras believed that the final would be one sided and that the victory of Banaras was confirmed. That's why more than half of the audience did not even come to watch the final. If nobody was not sure of Banaras's team victory, it was our team. As there were no coach with our team, so before the match, we players sat amongst ourselves and what we talked about was a summary - 'We had lost our match badly in the league, yet we had scored some points against them. So, we have to focus on how we had taken points in the last match and accordingly we have to take more points and win. We also discussed our mistakes made in the previous match and thought the ways to improve it. We went to play the match with the thought that if we couldn't win, then we will definitely show everyone that we too can give a good competition.

The match started. Initially, the Banaras team was playing comfortably, but as soon as our team's points started increasing, they were shocked and gave up playing their natural game. I remember completely, that team was so shocked after losing a set that the players of the team started fighting among themselves during the game because they were not mentally prepared for this situation. On the other hand our team used to shake hands at every point and encourage each other. As a result we defeated the Banaras team incredibly in three straight sets.

## third incident

I would like to mention one more special incident here. In the year 1999 in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, I was playing for the last time in the volleyball team of 'Vinoba Bhave University'. We knew that our first match would be held the next morning from the team of Ranchi University. We had all the new players in our team except me, my team setter Tej Narayan and a smasher Karnail Singh. Even all three of us had not played Senior Nationals till then and on the other hand almost all the players of Ranchi University team had played Senior Nationals and the team was also mature. His coach Shekhar Bose was the secretary of the Jharkhand Volleyball Association and a renowned international level coach. That is, they were far ahead of us in every respect.

The night before the match we went to have dinner with our coach in a restaurant. At the same time, the team of Ranchi University was already eating food there. During dinner, one of our junior players told us that Ranchi University players were talking among themselves that "Don't worry, eat comfortably because tomorrow morning we have to play a very easy match". We did not like to hear this. We ate our food half-heartedly and being the senior player and captain of the team, I instructed everyone to come to my room before sleeping. We did not even tell this to our coach Mr. Shatanku Sen as we realized from his words that he too was confident of our defeat in the next day's match.

When all the players sat together at night, I first gave the junior players a chance to present their view one by one. Then, besides me, both the senior players put their points. We made our strategy keeping in mind all possible circumstances of the next day's match. Being the captain, I finally spoke. I inspired my team with these words, "We have to play thinking that we are pulling a mountain with a rope, if we will loose, only we will loose our rope, but if we will win, the we will win the mountain. We have very little to lose and a lot to gain. All we have to do is to give our best. Everyone here should know that no one makes a mistake intentionally, so if someone in the team makes a mistake, we have to encourage them to play better instead of blaming them. Let us all know that we have to play with this very team and win or lose will belong to all of us and not to any of us."

The next day our team performed an unexpected game. The first set when we defeated the Ranchi University team by 30 points against 28, their team morale and cohesion were shattered. But our new players were so happy winning a set that they felt they had won the entire match. That is why we lost the next set. After that, we senior players called everyone and explained that until the full match is over, the focus is to keep the match and remember that we can play a little bit better than the way we won the first set and we need to learn from the set we have lost. We then started playing with full fervor and eventually defeated the team which looked better than us in all respects by 03 sets compared to 01. This win has been the best win of my 20 years of professional sports life.

## applying these learnings

There is some similarity and some difference in the above three events but based on these three events, I wanted to tell you these main valuable things for teamwork and it's successful application

1. **Develop A Vision** If anyone wants to create a team or lead a team and wants to develop a well defined teamwork first of all he should develop a clear vision for the team. It means every team members should know clearly about aim and objectives of the team. The leader should also create an appealing team mission statement too.

1. **Be approachable to every member of the team** A good team leader should always be approachable to his teammates so that they can feel acquainted. It decreases the chance of miscommunication and communication gap.

1. **Give every member importance** If a leader wants to create a good teamwork quality he should give equal importance to each member of the team but tell them according to situation the attention towards some specific teammates may vary. I think one should be transparent in his behavior towards other teammates.

1. **Be A Specialist Of Your Field** One who wants to lead a team should be a specialist at least any one of the department or part of it's faculty.

1. **Lead by Example** If one wants to create the quality of teamwork among teammates he should lead by example rather than instructions.
   Instructions without examples don't have much enforce.

1. **Provide Honest Feedback** An honest feedback is necessary for uplifting the energy and enthusiasm among teammates. For better results a leader should always keep it in the mind

   > 'Praise and admire on public but complain and rectify in private.'

1. **Encourage Personal Growth Of Teammates** Every individual want his growth naturally. So, for making a quality people team there should be a clear vision for everyone's growth. If team will grow together there will be better bonding among them.

1. **Celebrate Accomplishments** A good team should celebrate it's accomplishments on regular intervals. It keeps the group alive.

1. **Offer On The Spot Incentives** If a leader wants to enhance the level of creativity and enthusiasm of teammates he should offer some on the spot incentives even for the teammates for accomplishment of simple tasks. It may be standing ovation from other members or some hour work leave or anything but it is observed that on the spot incentives work miracles in enhancing teamwork results.

## practical tips for team

Now we should discuss the best practical tip to become more productive by deputing the task among teammates in such a way that it works as a win-win theory for all them . Even if the person who is not leading a team and preparing for some other project or doing something separately can follow these steps.

## prioritise your work

First prioritise your works in hand in three basic categories:

In number 01, you have to put all your most important tasks which can't be accomplished by others. Means you are the best for these tasks among your teammates.

In number 02, the most important tasks for the team which should be transferred to your teammates. Means some of your teammates can do it better than you.

In number 03, you have to put the works which should be done but not must be done. Means the tasks which are less important for the teams and could be procrastinated for sometime. Further you can give ranking in these categories separately like 01A, 01B, and 01C or 02A, 02B and 02C etc. according to your need and priorities.

## second level

Now you have to depute the second level task to the most suitable teammate. The aim and objectives of the task given to the teammates should be clear. Their roles and responsibilities in achieving the common goal of the team should be well describe to them, which gives every teammates the zeal and enthusiasm to play their positive role in teaching towards the common goal of your team. All the best to everyone to select the best team for achieving a worthy goal of their life.

At last for better concept about teamwork I want to share a true and interesting story of successful team and secret of their teamwork. It is as --

Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Keith Richards, and Ronnie Wood – The Rolling Stones – have played together for more than 50 years. However, they still recognise the importance of practising together.

They understand that for excellence to become a habit, you need to define a shared approach to working together. You need to practise it over and over until it becomes second nature.

Before every tour, the band typically commits two months to rehearsing. They appreciate the opportunity to reconnect with their collective rhythm. The practice enables the band to perform with almost telepathic communication.

Richards says that he knows exactly what’s happening by simply watching Watts’ left hand. If the tempo ever drags, one glance from Richards to Wood speaks volumes. Together they will then step up the pace.

The Stones’ success comes from each member having a distinctive yet complementary role. Richards is their spiritual leader, Watts the band’s backbone, Wood the mediator, and Jagger is in control of everything he can be – a chief executive in many ways.

Each of the band’s members is a talent in his own right, but it is the chemistry the band has on each of them that works best. Being part of the Rolling Stones remains the best way for each member to achieve their individual goals. The best teams are those who combine individual drive with understanding the importance and power of the team.

This is the secret to becoming an excellent team: There is no substitute for the ongoing commitment and deliberate practice required to build better teams.

All the best to everyone to be a member of his dream team.
